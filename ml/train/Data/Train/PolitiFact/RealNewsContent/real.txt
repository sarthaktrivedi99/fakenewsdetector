The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader.\n\n\"I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,\" Trump said Monday on Fox News. \"I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over.\"\n\nHe later said, \"I've already met with a couple,\" but refused to say which ones.\n\nClinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president.\n\nClinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi.\n\nWhile reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the \"path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties.\"\n\nTrump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed \"the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,\" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting.\n\n\"Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,\" the Trump campaign said.\n\nThe Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his \"high regard for peace-loving Muslims,\" the campaign added.\n\nThe campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship \"vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East.\"\n\nSisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month.\n\nSitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily \"the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression.\" Clinton added that she was \"anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.\"\n\nClinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House.\n\n\"If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,\" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. \"While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins.\"\n\nThe meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.\n\nTrump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto earlier this year.\n\nThe meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it.\n\nClinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's \"embarrassing international incident.\"\n\n\"When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,\" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting.\n\nFor her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.\n\nInstead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.\n\nClinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.\n\nClinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian \"aggression\" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself.\n\nCurrently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians.\n\nClinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration.\n\nClinton, according to an aide in the room, \"emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress\" and \"discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS.\"\n\nClinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.\n\nClinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nSisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,\" the official said.\n\nTrump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who \"recognize that this ideology of death\" must be extinguished.\n\nClinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.\n\nClinton, according to an aide, discussed \"the threat from North Korea\" and \"relations with China\" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected.\n\nThere is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take."}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_17-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "In total, 37 states and the District of Columbia will allow early voting in 2016. | AP Photo When does early voting start in every state?

So far, voting is limited to a smattering of counties and municipalities in states that allow local governments to set their own schedules. On Friday, however, voters statewide in South Dakota and Minnesota will be allowed to cast early ballots.

Some of those states allow voters to request mail ballots and send them in, while others open physical polling places weeks or even months before the election. In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case.\n\nTypically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said.\n\nHere\u2019s when early voting begins in each state.\n\n(Note, the below dates represent the earliest date that voters statewide can send for a ballot or vote in person without a special exemption.)\n\nAlabama \u2014 There\u2019s no universal early voting in Alabama, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.\n\nAlaska \u2014 Oct. 24.\n\nArizona \u2014 Oct. 12.

Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved.\n\nThe key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said \u2014 giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9.

Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood \u2014 particularly Profamilias, the health care provider\u2019s partner in Puerto Rico \u2014 from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said.\n\nLanguage in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine that\u2019s delayed Zika aid for months.\n\nDespite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said \u201cno\u201d when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day.\n\n\u201cClose is relative,\u201d Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach.\n\nFor instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill.\n\nBut Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested they wouldn\u2019t accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package.\n\n\u201cLouisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do Flint.\u201d\n\nAnother issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to hand over the U.S. government\u2019s authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1 \u2014 a push that\u2019s being led by Texas Sen.

Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. \u201cAnd every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million \u2014 which it hasn\u2019t been able to do because three of the five seats on the bank\u2019s board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election.\n\nThere are other items that could fill up the Senate\u2019s legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThough Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so.\n\nRepublicans \u2014 who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance \u2014 privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:"}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_11-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "Trump: 'I was going to say something extremely rough' to Clinton\n\nHillary Clinton didn't hold back in her attacks on Donald Trump Monday night, but Donald Trump intimated that he pulled a key punch \u2014 passing on making a reference to Bill Clinton's past infidelities.\n\n\u201cI was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,\u201d Trump said in reply. \u201cIt's inappropriate.

Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.\n\nThere is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was \u201cno bigger jagoff in the world.\u201d\n\nThe indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets \u2014 that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.\n\nClinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton\u2019s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Trump\u2019s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.\n\nAn hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , \u201cIt sounds like you admitted you haven\u2019t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?\u201d Trump replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that at all.\u201d\n\nTrump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:\n\nI get audited every year my taxes are \u2014 it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of \u2014 do what the law recommends. But I\u2019m not against paying taxes. And I\u2019ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn\u2019t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I\u2019m, I\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that\u2019s been great to us. And you can\u2019t just take, take, take, take, take, take.\n\n.@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV \u2014 Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016\n\nThe contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\n\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed.

And he took a shot at Obama\u2019s leadership, or lack thereof.\n\n\u201cWe all have to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world\u2019s leader. How can we lead when we can\u2019t even control our own cities?\u201d\n\nTrump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president\u2019s responsibility \u201cto address this crisis and save African-American lives,\u201d has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.\n\nTrump's overtures to black voters \u2014 often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences \u2014 have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cdrugs are a very, very big factor\u201d in what's happening in Charlotte.\n\nStill, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee said there \u201cjust seems that there\u2019s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a terrible thing that we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte \u2014 a great place \u2014 and you just see it.\u201d\n\nProtests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte.\n\nBy Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scott\u2019s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the family\u2019s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video \"can somehow help us reach that truth.\"\n\nJustin Bamberg, another of the family\u2019s attorney\u2019s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that \u201cpictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.\u201d He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scott\u2019s wife was present when he was shot.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,\u201d Bamberg said when asked why the family\u2019s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. \u201cYes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the \u201cdifficulties\u201d her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. \u201cI know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.\u201d\n\nWednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.\n\n\u201cI see it even going out. There\u2019s such a lack of \u2014 there\u2019s a lack of spirit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of something. Something\u2019s going on that\u2019s bad, and what\u2019s going on between police and others is getting worse.\u201d\n\nThe real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s wow, here we go again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. When you look at what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s very divided, our country, and it\u2019s getting worse. I\u2019m not overly surprised to see it, but it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nTrump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won\u2019t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was \u2014 that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but there\u2019s something deeper than that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from America\u2019s current leader.\n\n\u201cWell, it really has to be \u2014 you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there\u2019s no unity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. It\u2019s so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, it\u2019s so sad to see. But there\u2019s just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.\u201d\n\nBut what Trump didn\u2019t say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obama\u2019s lack of leadership.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after we\u2019ve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think that\u2019s a tragic failure of leadership,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\n\u201cBut my guess is he was afraid it\u2019d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,\u201d he added. \u201cHe could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Friday\u2019s shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was \u201ca more difficult situation\u201d than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the \u201cambiguous, troubling category.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut even there, you gotta say to people, \u2018Wait, let the investigation play out.\u2019 The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.\u201d\n\nAuthors:"}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_70-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "Washington (CNN) Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 6 points ahead of the first debate on Monday, according to a new national poll released Wednesday.\n\nA four-way matchup shows Clinton has 43% support of likely voters while Trump has 37%, in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll .

He is violating all the rules of the political game\u2014rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency\u2014and when 2016 is over, it\u2019s not clear whether those rules will still apply.\n\nWhatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who\u2019s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d or \u201cStronger Together.\u201d The small venues are selected to target niche groups\u2014millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando\u2014and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.\n\n\u201cI thought it was very substantial, very specific,\u201d Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a \u201cHil Yes!\u201d pin to Clinton\u2019s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. \u201cThe purpose wasn\u2019t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We\u2019re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.\u201d\n\nClinton had better hope not. There\u2019s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can\u2019t match. It\u2019s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you\u2019re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It\u2019s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (\u201cIt\u2019s 100 degrees in here. And that\u2019s considered cool for an auditorium.\u201d) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell\u2014the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world\u2014then moves onto another before the last fully explodes.\n\nClinton doesn\u2019t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump\u2019s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn\u2019t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.\n\nNobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton\u2019s campaign, like his accusations that it\u2019s \u201cpolicy-free,\u201d when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there\u2019s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches\u2014he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long\u2014with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.\n\n\u201cBom. Bom. Bom. See ya!\u201d Trump smirked. \u201cSee ya! I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nMany Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump\u2019s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he\u2019s shredding every day.\n\n***\n\nBefore attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I\u2019m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz\u2019s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.\n\nTrump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the \u201cbad, dishonest, very bad people\u201d in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word \u201csir\u201d to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as \u201ca big fat bubble,\u201d and predicted a collapse that would be \u201cbeautiful to watch.\u201d He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: \u201cI didn\u2019t put him there! I\u2019m not paying him!\u201d He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself \u201cmore militaristic than anyone in this room,\u201d complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year\u2014actually the president\u2019s salary\u2014and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.\n\n\u201cWhoever the hell brought this mic system\u2014don\u2019t pay the son of a bitch!\u201d he seethed. \u201cDon\u2019t pay em. Don\u2019t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn\u2019t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they\u2019ll pay, they don\u2019t care. So we\u2019re not going to pay. I guarantee, I\u2019m not paying for this mic.\u201d\n\nSo I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola\u2019s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: \u201cTyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!\u201d The crowd started chanting \u201cLOCK HER UP!\u201d before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and\u2026well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said one Trump supporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty\u2026 Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nTrump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clich\u00e9s and Republican talking points about \u201cencrusted insiders\u201d and \u201cturning the page.\u201d He said the kind of things regular politicians say: \u201cThe history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.\u201d And: \u201cOnce again, we\u2019ll have a government of, by, and for the people.\u201d He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd\u2014during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: \u201cWhat about white people?\u201d\u2014but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall\u2014but really, who still thinks about them?\n\nAfterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn\u2019t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing \u201call the problems in the world,\u201d including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that \u201cpersonally, I think she\u2019s an unstable person,\u201d and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone \u201cright smack in the middle of the heart\u2014and she wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted, OK?\u201d He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin\u2014and then he had cozied up again: \u201cHe\u2019s been nice to me, and if he\u2019s nice to me, that\u2019s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, would it?\u201d And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that \u201cthe country is collapsing.\u201d\n\nThose all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We\u2019re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military \u201cincredibly weak,\u201d defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community\u2014which endured slavery and Jim Crow\u2014was \u201cin the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!\u201d Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline \u201cRestraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.\u201d Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton\u2019s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn\u2019t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn\u2019t make it through one.\n\nThat sort of behavior just hasn\u2019t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it\u2019s that defiant you-can\u2019t-tell-me-what-I\u2019m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. \u201cHe\u2019s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people\u2019s feelings, always watching our P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, so it\u2019s cool to see him speak his mind,\u201d said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing\u2014he doesn\u2019t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn\u2019t stumble around like she did on the video\u2014Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: \u201cHe\u2019ll call a spade a spade, and if you don\u2019t like it you can shove it.\u201d Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. \u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we\u2019re offensive. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off\u2014at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn\u2019t want hate in their state: \u201cLazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!\u201d He explained to me that America was under siege, with \u201cthousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,\u201d and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\nThe Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition\u2014and they seemed less anxious than pissed off.\n\nOne of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: \u201cWe want our state rights back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,\u201d says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don\u2019t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. \u201cTrump is saying what we\u2019re all thinking: \u2018Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don\u2019t end where your feelings begin!\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as \u201cthe oldest play in the Democratic playbook.\u201d And he\u2019s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it\u2019s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: \u201cI\u2019ll say it openly, and some people don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t really care: What do you have to lose?\u201d His long riffs about how he\u2019ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can\u2019t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don\u2019t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent\u2014the real rate is about one third of that\u2014he\u2019s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya\u2014and many I spoke to believe he\u2019s also a Muslim who supports ISIS.\n\nOne notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. \u201cA lot of us who like him don\u2019t like the stuff he says about race,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cObviously, some do.\u201d\n\nThis really isn\u2019t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal\u2014a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams\u2014she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.\n\nI remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it.\n\nIn 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She\u2019s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn\u2019t been about standard anything.\n\n***\n\nNearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton\u2019s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an \u201cInclusive Economy,\u201d to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters\u2014a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse\u2014about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton\u2019s concern about a worthy issue.\n\nIt did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a nice speech,\u201d Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. \u201cNot very exciting, but I believe she\u2019ll do what she says.\u201d\n\nThe speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.\n\nThe rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: \u201cAcross the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They\u2019re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.\u201d Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. \u201cIn the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,\u201d Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.\n\nClinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children\u2019s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department\u2019s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she\u2019s known\u2014including the \u201cunbelievably good-looking\u201d actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that \u201cfamily values\u201d should mean that every family has value\u2014and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the \u201csub-minimum wage\u201d that is currently paid to some disabled workers.\n\nThe audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a \u201creally slow, vicious death\u201d to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn\u2019t feel bad if they\u2019re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton\u2019s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton\u2019s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn\u2019t even mention Trump\u2019s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.\n\nGeannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nIn fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down\u2019s Syndrome and lead a productive life. \u201cWhat Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,\u201d Kilsheimer said. \u201cI know a lot of people don\u2019t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she\u2019s got heart.\u201d\n\nGeannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton\u2019s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they\u2019re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren\u2019t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it\u2019s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump\u2019s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. \u201cMy daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We\u2019ve got plenty to lose,\u201d said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.\u201d\n\nMany Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump\u2019s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019re all Mexicans, and we\u2019re all bad,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they\u2019ll come out to stop Trump.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. \u201cShe\u2019s OK, I guess,\u201d said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. \u201cMy main worry is Trump\u2019s fingers on the nuclear code. But I\u2019d say she knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they\u2019re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she\u2019s a typical lying politician, so they\u2019re voting for Trump\u2014and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they\u2019re staying home.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s great on the issues, but it\u2019s hard to get people to focus on that.\u201d\n\nClinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband\u2019s administration and recovery during Obama\u2019s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. \u201cWhen Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,\u201d said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. \u201cMan, Hillary should talk about that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn\u2019t focused on his policies, because they\u2019re so insubstantial and flexible, because he\u2019s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It\u2019s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump\u2019s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump.\n\nSo Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They\u2019ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it.\n\n***\n\nTonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump\u2019s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump\u2019s political brand is all about breaking the rules.\n\nWhat is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president\u2019s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can\u2019t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight\u2019s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won\u2019t be normal, but it won\u2019t be the first time, either.\n\nAnd yes, even though she\u2019s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo\u2014not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She\u2019s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn\u2019t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn\u2019t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they\u2019ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.\n\nBut the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren\u2019t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they\u2019re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values\u2014showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren\u2019t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences\u2014that have constrained politicians in a good way. It\u2019s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they\u2019re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted.

Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.\n\nThere is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was \u201cno bigger jagoff in the world.\u201d\n\nThe indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million.

Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton\u2019s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Trump\u2019s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.\n\nAn hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it.

And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of \u2014 do what the law recommends. But I\u2019m not against paying taxes. And I\u2019ll give you a perfect example.

No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\n\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him.

A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\n\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. \u201cWith his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,\u201d Steiniger tells POLITICO.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. \u201cHe stands for everything that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Sarah B\u00fchler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town\u2019s main square. B\u00fchler is a former local \u201cwine princess,\u201d the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\n\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the town\u2019s annual festival: Saumagen-D\u00f6ner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. \u201cEveryone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,\u201d says B\u00fchler. \u201cPink, purple, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. \u201cThey don\u2019t get that we really don\u2019t give a damn about Trump,\u201d says Huber. \u201cHe\u2019s never been here, and he apparently doesn\u2019t care about us, either.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nDonald\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner\u2019s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cDromb\u201d and \u201cTrumpff,\u201d according to local historians, or even \u201cDrumpf,\u201d according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on \u201cTrump.\u201d\n\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\n\nFriedrich\u2019s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\n\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. \u201cBoth he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,\u201d said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship \u201cas his own request\u201d four years after arriving in the U.S.\n\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\n\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. \u201cMy grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\n\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended \u201cto return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,\u201d he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair\u2019s family history.\n\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was \u201cto be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife \u2014 pregnant once more \u2014 had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald\u2019s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\n\n\u201c[The authorities] said, \u2018You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,\u201d says Walter. \u201cSo they left and they went back to America, and that\u2019s why Donald and I are here.\u201d\n\nFriedrich \u2014 now named Frederick \u2014 died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\n\n* * *\n\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on \u201cKings of Kallstadt,\u201d a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\n\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump\u2019s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\n\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower\u2019s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\n\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump\u2019s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. \u201cHis assistant just couldn\u2019t be bothered,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHello, John,\u201d Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin\u2019s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.\n\nTrump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. \u201cAfterwards, I just kept on thinking, \u2018What on earth did I do?\u2019\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe cake looks really good,\u201d Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.\n\nUntil 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. \u201cThey grow them well in Kallstadt,\u201d he told her during their meeting. \u201cThey grow them very well. Believe me. It\u2019s good stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWhen their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard the word Kallstadt?\u201d Wendel asked him.\n\n\u201cKallstadt?\u201d Trump Junior replied, \u201cNo, what is it?\u201d"}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_68-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "Story highlights The tweet took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week\n\n\"We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,\" Trump said\n\nBoise, Idaho (CNN) Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was \"trying to point out things that have to be said.\"\n\n\"People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,\" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. \"For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy.

The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scott\u2019s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn\u2019t armed and was only carrying a book.\n\nAs usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scott\u2019s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another \u201cproof\u201d that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting.\n\nAs it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and there\u2019s no reason to think he wouldn\u2019t have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported:\n\nRakeyia Scott\u2019s cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a gun\u2014even as he brandished a gun in front of them\u2014now appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children\u2019s schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment they\u2019d called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, \u201cHe is no longer a threat to me and my family.\u201d But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. \u201cHe said he is a \u2018killer\u2019 and we should know that,\u201d she wrote. She said the man she\u2019d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before.\n\nThe Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time.

He\u2019s a young politician. He\u2019s a Hispanic, He can win.

He is still, I believe, a good man,\u201d Beck said. \u201cHe is just a politician first. I\u2019ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that\u2019s my fault. He is a politician.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November.\n\nAfter Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).\n\n\u201cSo a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross \u2014 it\u2019s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, \u2018Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,\u2019 I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it\u2019s a binary choice?\u201d Beck asked.\n\n\u201cYou are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,\u201d Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America.\n\nBeck, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cThis is information that you had in Cleveland \u2014 and hang on just a second before you respond \u2014 you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,\u201d Beck said. \u201cSo you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: \u2018Oh, my gosh, he\u2019s now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there\u2019s a reason to believe him.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite his \u201csignificant disagreements\u201d with Trump, Cruz said, it\u2019s a binary choice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking for new information. I\u2019m asking you for new information,\u201d Beck said. \u201cYou knew all the things that you\u2019re saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? What\u2019s new?\u201d\n\nCruz pointed to the Trump campaign\u2019s release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nAfter Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. \u201cNow, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising \u2018I will nominate from these 21,\u2019 I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that\u2019s a clear choice.\u201d\n\nCruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that he\u2019s always been \u201cNever Hillary\u201d but not ever \u201cNever Trump.\u201d He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter.\n\n\u201cMy speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBoth of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.\u201d\n\nAfter Cruz\u2019s appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. \u201cHe could have come on and said, \u2018Look, guys, here\u2019s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,\u2019 and I know that, because so are mine,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019My donors, who are all in with the GOP, they\u2019re all saying I\u2019ll never fund \u2014 I won\u2019t fund you for the Senate.

The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.\n\nAnd, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency.\n\nWith four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate.\n\n\n\nHear CNN Political Director David Chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast:\n\nWhat's changed?\n\n-- Iowa (6) moves from from \"battleground\" to \"lean Republican\"\n\n-- Utah (6) moves from \"lean Republican\" to \"solid Republican\"\n\n-- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from \"solid Democrat\" to \"battleground\"\n\n-- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from \"solid Republican\" to \"battleground\"\n\nRoad to 270: Electoral College map\n\nNote: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.\n\nThe state of play\n\nDonald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up \"battleground\" category into the \"lean Republican\" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.\n\nThat leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.\n\nMaine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from \"solid Democrat\" to \"battleground\" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from \"solid Republican\" to \"battleground,\" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.\n\nFinally, Utah moves back from \"leaning Republican\" to being solidly being in Trump's column.\n\nThere is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging.\n\nFor all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump.\n\nIt is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall.\n\nThat's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio.\n\nClinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.\n\nSolid Republican:\n\nAlabama (9), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (3), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (38), Utah (6)West Virginia (5), Wyoming (3) (163 total)\n\nLeans Republican:\n\nArizona (11), Georgia (16), Iowa (6), (33 total)\n\nBattleground states:\n\nFlorida (29), Nevada (6), Ohio (18), Maine 2nd Congressional District (1) Nebraska 2nd Congressional District (1), North Carolina (15) (70 total)\n\nLeans Democratic:\n\nColorado (9), Michigan (16), New Hampshire (4), Pennsylvania (20), Virginia (13), Wisconsin (10), (72 total)\n\nSolid Democratic:\n\nCalifornia (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), DC (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maine (3), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3), Washington (12), Minnesota (10), New Mexico (5) (200 total)"}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_2-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "24.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in America didn\u2019t exist until President Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any racism until Obama got elected.

It\u2019s Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot.\n\nLike Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginia\u2019s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trump\u2019s strongest states.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWest Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49\u201331 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders\u2019 51 percent in the state\u2019s May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.\n\nThat\u2019s led to a dynamic in which West Virginia\u2019s GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. It\u2019s very nearly the opposite of what\u2019s happening in other states with close races.\n\n\u201cAcross the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, it\u2019s pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,\u201d says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cThis is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.\u201d\n\nIn this race, Trump isn\u2019t a drag on Republicans; he\u2019s an asset.\n\nThe reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with \u201cwar on coal\u201d rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. It\u2019s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russia\u2019s OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.\n\nCole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but he\u2019s no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.\n\nIn a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,\u201d says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. \u201cIf you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are known\u2014the wall, universal health care, the coal industry\u2014but so much of what\u2019s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.\u201d\n\nJustice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. He\u2019s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he won\u2019t vote for Clinton and dismissed Cole\u2019s claim that he supports Obama as \u201ccomplete dog snot.\u201d\n\nAnd while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate \u201cisn\u2019t focused on the national political circus,\u201d the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. \u201cJim is no politician,\u201d says Herring. \u201cHe is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent.\n\nMany doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. \u201cDo I think Justice has a lead? Yes,\u201d says Gates. \u201cDo I think it\u2019s double digits? No.\u201d\n\nSome of that is because Justice\u2019s industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOP\u2019s otherwise effective \u201cwar on coal\u201d messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d says Dave \u201cMudcat\u201d Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said he\u2019s voting for Trump, says voters don\u2019t trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. \u201cShe said she\u2019s going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners don\u2019t want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d says one Democratic strategist.\n\nBut Saunders doesn\u2019t have kind words for Justice either: \u201cHe\u2019s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.\u201d\n\nCole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justice\u2019s business record over the next several weeks. \u201cJim Justice is a coal operator, but he\u2019s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,\u201d Gates says. \u201cHis legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.\u201d\n\nThat record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice \u201cstands out\u201d among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.\n\nThe problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justice\u2019s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. That\u2019s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million.\n\nThe pattern apparently extends to Justice\u2019s other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.\n\nJustice\u2019s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.\n\nBoth Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy that\u2019s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, West Virginia\u2019s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy.\n\nMines sit idle as a string of industry giants\u2014 Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energy\u2014filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it\u2019s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.\n\nThe coal industry\u2019s struggles haven\u2019t just hurt West Virginia\u2019s employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.\n\nJustice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, he\u2019s brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints\u2019 training camp to the Greenbrier.\n\nIn late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.\n\nJustice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrier\u2019s reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.\n\nWhether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governor\u2019s race from \u201cLeans Republican\u201d to \u201cToss-up.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,\u201d Kondik says.\n\nTrump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governor\u2019s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. That\u2019s why Cole\u2019s campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesn\u2019t matter, so long as they\u2019re not voting for Justice.\n\nIn his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: \u201cAt the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do what\u2019s best for Jim Justice.\u201d\n\nThat line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether what\u2019s in Justice and Trump\u2019s best interests is in theirs, too.\n\nMason Adams writes from southwest Virginia.

No one was injured.\n\nSaturday night's blast in the bustling Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. In the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appears to be changing.\n\n\"The more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism,\" de Blasio said in a later interview on NY1 News.\n\nCuomo, in a separate interview on MSNBC, said: \"Today's information suggests it may be foreign related but we'll see where it goes. ...

Chuck Schumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover\n\nChuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now he\u2019s starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader.\n\nThe New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm on Tuesday. He\u2019s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEarlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls.\n\nRepublicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way.\n\n\u201cThe Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to allocate our resources so they\u2019re meaningful to us and our candidates.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.\n\nSchumer\u2019s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party\u2019s candidates and a reflection of Democrats\u2019 future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.\n\nSchumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates\u2019 committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. He\u2019s planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates that\u2019s projected to bring in \u201cupwards of another million,\u201d according to a person close to the New York senator.\n\n\u201cSchumer has been relentless,\u201d said a DSCC official.\n\nSchumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them.\n\n\u201cLeader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,\u201d McCue said in a statement.\n\nSchumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.\n\nSchumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumer\u2019s colleagues won\u2019t rule out the possibility that he\u2019ll donate more to his party\u2019s Senate takeover effort.\n\n\u201cIf he thinks it will make a difference, he\u2019ll do it. He\u2019s very calculating,\u201d said a Democratic senator. \u201cChuck will be there if you need him.\u201d\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to watch everything closely. It\u2019s my sense he\u2019s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,\u201d Stabenow said.\n\nThere\u2019s no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make some tough decisions, which haven\u2019t been made yet,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said he\u2019ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,\u201d Thune said in an interview.\n\nRepublicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublicans, however, simply don\u2019t have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner.

Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nThe CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.\n\nThe congressional report focused on Clinton\u2019s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.\n\nIt also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation\u2019s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\n\u201cWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA\u2019s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, \u201calleged due to the company\u2019s diluted drugs, it \u2018subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,\u2019\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, \u2018how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,\u2019\u201d asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered \u201cmore than $1.8 million packages.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,\u201d Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the company\u2019s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\n\u201cThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,\u201d he said.\n\nRanbaxy\u2019s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public \u201cwarning letter\u201d to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company\u2019s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, \u201cshow much lower potencies in these batches.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company\u2019s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he\u2019s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on \u201caccess\u201d to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. \u201cI have tried to reach out to them,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the \u201cfalse hopes\u201d offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it\u2019s disturbing and very sad,\u201d she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com"}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_101-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "We are absolutely heartbroken to hear about the death of someone that was so special to everyone in country music.\n\nShe always had a smile on her face and she lit up any room that she walked into.

It was Hillary Clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of Donald Trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor.\n\nSo what\u2019s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? It has to do with Trump\u2019s not failing badly. He did not show himself to be \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency, which was Clinton\u2019s main accusation against him. In the countless other occasions\u2014from his announcement speech on\u2014the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that Trump\u2019s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. His supporters\u2014and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought\u2014do not hear him the way those of us who\u2019ve covered campaigns do. The insults, the sneers? That just shows he\u2019s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. And what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on Monday night)? It doesn\u2019t matter, because he\u2019s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf he\u2019s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again Monday night.\n\nMeasured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is \u201cunfit\u201d for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional Republicans have argued? Clinton did bring up the 50 GOP national security experts who have rejected him, but Trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him.\n\nAnd what of other standard measure? Atmospherics? She was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle Marco Rubio impersonation. Demeanor? It\u2019s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing.\n\nOn the respective vulnerabilities? He launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then \u2026 the issue went away. By contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the \u201cbirther\u201d issue, which he linked to outright racism. And his \u201cdefenses\u201d\u2014that he \u201dtook advantage of the laws of the nation\u201d in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes\u2014were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. It\u2019s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that \u201cthe people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\u201d\n\nMoreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out \u201cracist:\u2019 charging he\u2019d \u201cstiffed\u201d many of those who\u2019d worked for him. (She managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for Trump.)\n\nFinally, at the very end of the debate, moderator Lester Holt confronted Trump with his statement that Clinton did not have the \u201clook\u201d of a president\u2014a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. When Trump tried to shift the ground to a question of \u201cstamina,\u201d a smiling Clinton was ready.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cas soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201d\n\nThat worked very well. I have little doubt that Clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. But if this campaign so far has proven anything, it\u2019s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. And I\u2019m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author."}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_116-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "Mike Pence said \"we ought to set aside this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias.\" | AP Photo Pence: There's too much talk of police department 'racism'\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. \u2014 Mike Pence said there is too much talk of \"institutional racism and institutional bias\" in the wake of unrest following police shootings in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\n\"Police officers are human beings,\" Pence said at a pastors' roundtable at Radiant Church here. \"And in difficult and life-threatening situations, mistakes are made and people have to be held to strict account, but we both believe that it's important that we have a president who, as the chief law enforcement officer of the United States, stands behind the men and women who serve in law enforcement.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPence said that police officers are \"the best of us.\"\n\n\"We ought to set aside this talk, this talk about institutional racism and institutional bias,\" he said, calling such assertions \"rhetoric of division.\"\n\nAsked by Bishop John Brannon, who is African-American, what Pence would \"personally do\" to heal divides in the country, Pence brought up the recent shootings.\n\n\"When there's any loss of life, we have to speak with compassion, we have to make it clear that there will be a thorough investigation and that justice will be served and that high standards will be upheld,\" Pence said.\n\nPence sought to strike a tone of unity in his remarks, repeating that \"there will always be more that unites us in this country than could ever divide us.\"\n\nAt a town hall event shortly after the pastors roundtable, Pence used the same line \u2014 that there is too much talk of \"institutional racism\" \u2014 to take aim at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"But in the wake of these tragic events in Tulsa and Charlotte, sadly our opponent once again refers to what she calls the institutional racism in law enforcement,\" Pence said. \"We heard this week again of the 'systemic racism' in law enforcement in this country.\"\n\nPence said people expect a \"thorough, immediate and transparent investigation\" in the wake of police shootings.\n\nPence went on to say that police are \"not a force for racism in America, they are a force for good, they stand for our families, they protect our homes and they deserve our support and respect.\"\n\nHe also said he respected protesters' constitutional right to assemble, but added \"there is no right to engage in violence against our citizens or against our property.\"\n\nTrump expressed his own concern about the Tulsa shooting on Wednesday, suggesting the shooting happened because the officer in question was \u201cchoking\u201d under pressure.\n\nAuthors:"}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_34-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "80510 SHARES Facebook Twitter Reddit Stumbleupon Pinterest\n\nEarlier this week, as part of an interview he gave to Fox News, Donald Trump announced he had just learned that Ford Motor Company was about to \u201cfire all their employees in the United States and\u2026move to Mexico.\u201d Trump went on to add that when he becomes President, Ford would have to pay a 35 percent tax on any car they send back to the United States for sale.\n\nWow! That\u2019s big news! It\u2019s also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.\u201d\n\nCNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico?

Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will Hillary Clinton\u2019s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president?\n\nExperience suggests it\u2019s hard to make a positive breakthrough\u2014especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOver the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe\u2014a mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate.\n\nDespite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debates don\u2019t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters\u2019 impressions\u2014which matters on Election Day.\n\nFor both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds\u2014which could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under Trump\u2019s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into.\n\n1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK\n\nFamously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation.\n\nOn September 26, at the candidates\u2019 first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked.\n\nVideo: The Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audience question\u2014here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history.\n\nDuring their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadow didn\u2019t help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor.\n\n2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis\n\nA more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in Philadelphia\u2019s Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems.\n\nNeither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates \u201cstood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins,\u201d wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post.\n\nYears later, Ford admitted that \u201cI suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren\u2019t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.\u201d In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights.\n\n3. 1980: Carter\u2019s grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious\n\nIn politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carter didn\u2019t get that lesson.\n\nIn front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the far right\u2014someone like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964.\n\nWhile Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: \u201cThere you go again,\u201d he said with a laugh. The line undercut Carter\u2019s entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man.\n\n4. 1984: Mondale lets Reagan\u2019s one-liner negate a serious weakness\n\nDuring 1984\u2019s first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer \u201cthat he had flopped.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: \u201cNew Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?\u201d\n\nFortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: \u201cI will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d\n\nThe audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge.\n\n5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question\n\nPerhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988.\n\nDukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: \u201cGovernor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\u201d\n\nReporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said \u201cNo, I don\u2019t Bernard, and I think you know that I\u2019ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don\u2019t see any evidence that it\u2019s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\u201d\n\nIt was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. \u201cIt was a question about Dukakis\u2019s values and emotions,\u201d his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. \u201cWhen he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.\u201d\n\n6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question\n\nDuring the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.\n\nRight before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. \u201cOnly 10 more minutes of this crap,\u201d Bush would later say he was thinking at the time.\n\nChecking the time would\u2019ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did\u2014during a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidential candidates\u2014it seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him.\n\n7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush\n\nEntering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president.\n\nDuring the first debate, Gore\u2019s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response to Bush\u2019s answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized the Democrat\u2019s plans for their \u201cfuzzy math,\u201d Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration.\n\nAt the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making Gore\u2019s action look odd as the audience laughed.\n\nDonna Brazile, who ran Gore\u2019s campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but \u201con mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing \u2026 many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.\u201d\n\n8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry\n\nAfter the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when he couldn\u2019t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made about Bush\u2019s record.\n\nThough Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the critics weren\u2019t so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, \u201cFaces of Frustration,\u201d viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with Bush\u2019s angry looks on the right side.\n\n***\n\nAppearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event.\n\nAnd on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nJulian E.

Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, who have vowed to block any ambassador nomination for Cuba.\n\nStill, Obama's decision suggests he's willing to take on the risk of a dragged-out fight over a topic \u2014 Cuba-U.S. relations \u2014 that has increasing bipartisan support.\n\nThe island nation restored diplomatic ties with the U.S. in July 2015 after more than 50 years of hostility, and Obama considers America's new relationship with Cuba one of his signature foreign policy achievements.\n\nDeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Havana since it was re-established in 2015 and headed what was an American interests section there before that. He was widely believed to be the frontrunner for the ambassador's job should Obama select a nominee.\n\n\"The appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries,\" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision.\n\nAmong those appaluding Obama's decision was Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has long advocated for better U.S.-Cuba relations.\n\n\"Americans traveling & doing business in #Cuba will be well-served by the prompt confirmation of Jeff DeLaurentis to serve as US ambassador,\" Flake tweeted.\n\nBut although a growing number of Republicans have shown support for deepening ties to Cuba, it takes only a single senator to severely slow down a nomination process for an ambassador.\n\nAsked by POLITICO earlier this year whether he still held firm to his denouncement of the rapprochement with Cuba and his vow to block an ambassador confirmation, Rubio said yes.\n\n\"A U.S. ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial, closed regime,\u201d the senator, who is of Cuban descent, said as the one-year anniversary of Cuba-U.S. ties loomed.\n\nRubio's office subsequently issued a statement assailing the nomination.\n\n\"This nomination,\" Rubio said, \"should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people.\"\n\nAuthors:"}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_113-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "AP Photo Backtalk Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be.\n\nWriting as a former legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriating Clinton\u2019s record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump.\n\nWe should be clear that Walinsky\u2019s critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot.\n\nWalinsky finds in Trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. Any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, Trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with NATO and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the U.S. or to himself, and pledges that America\u2019s pride needs to be vindicated militarily. \u201cAmerica First,\u201d Trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of Charles Lindbergh to mind\u2014before excoriating President Obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the Islamic State.\n\nTo compare John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy to Donald Trump is\u2014well, I won\u2019t finish the sentence. Yes, Robert Kennedy turned against the Vietnam War, but not because he felt that America should retreat from the world. He opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of American interests. The result, as we know, was the death of Vietnamese and Americans and others who should not have died. JFK and RFK were internationalists. They understood that World War II left the United States with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. They understood that America must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. They understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. They made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively.\n\nWalinsky quotes Robert Kennedy\u2019s statement that if any member of the ExComm other than John F. Kennedy had been president during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. Ask yourself what a President Trump might have done in that moment. \u201cRestraint\u201d is not the word that comes to mind.\n\nThis is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of Muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the United States should have seized Iraq\u2019s oil resources as \u201cspoils to the victor.\u201d\n\nYes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rights violations\u2014a topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects.\n\nAll the evidence, provided again and again by Donald Trump\u2019s own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principle\u2014a man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If you don\u2019t like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.\n\nEven if Walinsky\u2019s diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen.\n\nTo say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existential question\u2014and history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.\n\nPeter Edelman is the Carmack Waterhouse professor of law and public policy at Georgetown University Law Center."}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_78-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "Story highlights House Speaker Paul Ryan and Donald Trump have had a tense relationship throughout the campaign\n\nRyan was in New York to address a luncheon\n\nWashington (CNN) Ivanka Trump, the Republican presidential nominee's daughter, met with House Speaker Paul Ryan in New York on Monday, an aide to the Republican congressman confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe meeting was requested by Ivanka Trump, according to the speaker's office.\n\n\"It was a productive conversation where Ryan spoke about his 2012 experience and Ivanka shared updates about her father's campaign,\" the aide said.\n\nRyan was in town to address a luncheon at the Economic Club of New York.\n\nRead More"}, {"file": "PolitiFact_Real_35-Webpage.json", "label": [1, 0], "text": "Toby Keith has been forced to cancel his show in South Carolina and it was totally unexpected.\n\nToby Keith was scheduled to perform at the Florence Civic Center in South Carolina on September 22 and he was forced to cancel.

Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.\n\nThe rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people\u2014women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of it,\u201d says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. \u201cThis whole county\u2019s very, very patriotic.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gone\u2014history is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.\n\nBut for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolina\u2019s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments\u2014223\u2014than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the \u201cNew South\u201d and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and it\u2019s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.\n\nThough a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governor\u2019s decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginia\u2019s southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansion\u2014known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy\u2014Confederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.\n\nThat ruling\u2014along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state\u2014prompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. \u201cIf you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you\u2019re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country\u2014to learn the good, the bad and ugly,\u201d Poindexter says.\n\nMany of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.\n\n\u201cEvery little statue\u2019s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,\u201d says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. \u201cAfrican-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they\u2019re using it for.\u201d\n\n***\n\nMark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. \u201cMy ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,\u201d Whitaker says.\n\nNow, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. \u201cThese monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,\u201d he says.\n\nMany of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.\n\nBut even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouth\u2019s monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. \u201cWe believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,\u201d Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so \u201cthere has been protection all along.\u201d\n\nWhen the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.\n\nBack in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents don\u2019t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument\u2014a position Whitaker finds ridiculous. \u201cWhy now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we\u2019re concerned about cost?\u201d\n\nHe says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. \u201cWe\u2019re on solid legal grounds to remove it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need four votes.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOther Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city\u2019s entire historic landscape.\n\nHe asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville \u201cby telling the full story of race through our public spaces.\u201d The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.\n\nIn the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic site\u2014the place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.\n\n\u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is spray painted on a monument to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia, in June 2015. | AP Photo\n\nRichmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. It\u2019s also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments\u2019 removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders\u2014such as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. \u201cRather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginia\u2019s history,\u201d Jones said in a statement last summer.\n\nDelegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although he\u2019s fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s far better than tearing down the current ones.\u201d\n\nIn his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is \u201cirrelevant.\u201d \u201cThey need to be respected,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what we know today. That\u2019s why these monuments are important.\u201d\n\nAyers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. \u201cThe white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. It\u2019s an amalgam of power and weakness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re meant to do work,\u201d Ayers says. \u201cThe work that they were meant to do, in some ways they\u2019re still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls \u201cThe War Between the States.\u201d Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.\n\nOne of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, \u201cwe just don\u2019t have a copy of the actual check.\u201d\n\nPoindexter says Franklin County \u201clost hundreds of its best men\u201d in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was \u201ca horrible process\u201d that had a big impact on the region.\n\nToday, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state\u2019s median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexter\u2019s efforts to save war monuments. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want anybody pulling any monuments down,\u201d Stanley says.\n\nSoon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the county\u2019s Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.\n\nCivil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge. \u201cTo be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.\u201d\n\nYet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the society\u2019s website, \u201cSpecial emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.\u201d\n\nConfederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and he\u2019s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. \u201cHe became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,\u201d says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.\n\nSpeaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isn\u2019t ready to surrender, either. He doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn\u2019t ruled it out. \u201cIf you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.\u201d\n\nLisa Rab is a journalist in Charlotte, N.C.

The city of New York recently ended \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico:\n\nIn a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address \u201cviolence in the black community\u201d and \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Trump responded by proposing that \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. \u201cI would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,\u201d Trump told the questioner.\n\nStop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.\n\nWhen the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\n\nFormer US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as \u201cdestructive\u201d in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added:\n\n\u201cIn short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.\u201d\n\nFeatured image via Flickr"}]
