[{"text": "Edward Snowden: Osama Bin Laden is Still Alive Living in the Bahamas:\n\nEdward Snowden (the NSA whistleblower) has made another astonishing revelation. He apparently has documents that prove Osama Bin Laden is on the CIA\u2019s payroll and currently living a luxury lifestyle in the Bahamas.\n\nIn 2013, Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency (NSA), released various documents regarding government surveillance programs. This resulted in him being charged for committing several crimes.\n\nAll of the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. Due to this and the fact he believed it was the correct decision to reveal the shocking extent of phone surveillance by U.S. intelligence agency, he had no choice but to flee.\n\nHe currently resides in Russia, this is where he has be offered asylum for one year. Snowden has yet again provided a shocking piece of information. The Moscow Tribune reports that Snowden claims that Osama Bin Laden the infamous former leader of Al Qaeda, is in fact still alive and is in receipt of cash courtesy of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\n\u201cI have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA\u2019s payroll,\u201d Snowden claims. \u201cHe is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.\u201d\n\nSnowden claims the CIA faked the death of Osama Bin Laden. After reporting him dead, the man himself and his family were moved to a secret location in the Bahamas.\n\n\u201cOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIA\u2019s most efficient operatives for a long time,\u201d Snowden claims. \u201cWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody\u2019s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.\u201d\n\nNaijaPicks say that these documents that prove this controversial claim are featured in his 2015 book.\n\nDespite the fact Snowden says he was trying to help the citizens of America by releasing these documents, he is still classed as a fugitive in the USA. This is also despite approximately 168,000 people signing a petition calling for Snowden to be pardoned. This was rejected by the White House rejected on July 28, 2015.\n\nWhilst resident in Hong Kong, Snowden was interviewed by several journalists inside a secret location. He was asked why he left his own country, his reply to The Guardian was:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a society that does these sort of things\u2026 I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded.\u201d\n\nSource : Unknown But Not Hidden; Image Source: Awareness Act", "file": "PolitiFact_Fake_91-Webpage.json"}, {"text": "11.3k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nDuring a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because \u201che would\u2019ve gotten it, if I wanted it.\u201d But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul \u2013 this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:\n\nOne of these stories is a lie\u2014a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump\u2019s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn\u2019t want to admit he lost.\n\nAssume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush\u2019s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies\u2014he had played the \u201ccash for outcomes\u201d political game for years\u2014he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush\u2019s opposition\u2014if Trump had wanted it.\n\nThe transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would\u2019ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump\u2019s na\u00efve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald\u2019s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:\n\nNow consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn\u2019t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple\u2014Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.\n\nWhy is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater \u201cscandal\u201d for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.\n\nRepublicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump\u2019s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party\u2019s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it\u2019s head.\n\nTrump\u2019s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it\u2019s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.\n\nSee for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there\u2019s no third option here:\n\nBush: \u201cThe one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something\u2014that was generous and gave me money\u2014was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.\u201d Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn\u2019t\u2014 Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn\u2019t get it, because I was opposed to\u2014 Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before\u2014 Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I\u2019m not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.\n\nTranscript of 2007 Trial Deposition:\n\nA lawyer asked Trump, \u201cDid you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?\u201d Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush\u2026and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn\u2019t you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn\u2019t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there\u2019s one very simple reason why I did it. That\u2019s that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they\u2019re supposed to be closed, if she doesn\u2019t have the foresight to make sure she doesn\u2019t get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we\u2019re supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child \u2013 a being who\u2019s done no wrong and only exists as its mother\u2019s mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you another thing \u2013 as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn\u2019t married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,\u201d the governor concluded.\n\nSource:newslo.com", "file": "PolitiFact_Fake_62-Webpage.json"}, {"text": "4.4k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nI\u2026can\u2019t\u2026even.\n\nThis is absolute madness and as hard as I\u2019m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can\u2019t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.\n\nI cannot say that I don\u2019t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It\u2019s just\u2026 is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.\n\nIt\u2019s going to blow up in his face.\n\nIn Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore\u2026 it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?\n\nYou be the judge of that.\n\nThe job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of \u201call things dangerous\u201d then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It\u2019s not possible.\n\nYou can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.\n\nAs if their job wasn\u2019t already hard enough in Obama\u2019s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being \u201cdisproportionately\u201d targeted, they can run.\n\nYes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.\n\nUp until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that\u2019s \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it\u2019s not important to get evidence when it\u2019s fresh, because it could hurt a thug\u2019s feelings.\n\nBasically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve\u2026if there\u2019s a runner.\n\nWhich\u2026let\u2019s be real, what thug doesn\u2019t run?\n\nPunchline: The law abiding ones!\n\nI\u2019m so funny.\n\nYou\u2019re welcome.", "file": "BuzzFeed_Fake_40-Webpage.json"}, {"text": "By Free Wood Post\n\nHOUSTON \u2014 It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water.\n\nNot long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the \u201cWar of Northern Aggression.\u201d In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a \u201cfake president\u201d and Attorney General Eric Holder as \u201crabidly un-American.\u201d However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin\u2019 take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to clarify Porter said,\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it\u2019s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won\u2019t be our leaders. It\u2019s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it\u2019s all gonna change back. I\u2019ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don\u2019t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It\u2019s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.\u201d\n\nSeveral at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter\u2019s remarks. LaPierre said, \u201cThey brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they\u2019d be better off just making me president.\u201d\n\nRead More!", "file": "PolitiFact_Fake_39-Webpage.json"}, {"text": "Website is Down For Maintenance", "file": "BuzzFeed_Fake_39-Webpage.json"}]
