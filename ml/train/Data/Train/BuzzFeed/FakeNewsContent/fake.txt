Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!\n\nThere are many questions about her health, and admittedly I\u2019m no expert. However I am a realist.\n\nI recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton\u2019s left hand.\n\nI further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.\n\nFurther rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn\u2019t appear to want to be president any longer.\n\nNo matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton\u2019s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won\u2019t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the \u201cconspirators.\u201d\n\nWorse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats.

That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.\n\nThe year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson \u201capproved\u201d that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly \u201cwar mongering\u201d opponent, Barry Goldwater.\n\nToday, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson\u2019s deceitful war policies, Goldwater\u2019s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation\u2019s media.\n\nI mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.\n\nObviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a \u201cDaisy\u201d remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.\n\nSomehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater\u2019s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.\n\nInstead, today\u2019s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as \u201cnews and views.\u201d With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media\u2019s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.\n\nNow, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted\u2019s \u201cdramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.\u201d This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and \u201cutterly amoral.\u201d\n\nAs the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of \u201c\u2019Lyin Ted,\u2019 insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F.

So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?\n\nAnother safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived.

This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the \u201cliberal press\u201d moniker has now everyday acceptance.\n\nIt is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event.

The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company\u2019s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.\n\nSources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment\u2019s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump\u2019s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. \u201cThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIronically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee\u2019s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel\u2019s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he\u2019s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.\n\nThiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan\u2019s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire\u2019s then-secret sexual orientation.\n\nBut now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP\u2019s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, \u201cEvery American has a unique identity.

Not only is Hillary Clinton\u2019s health constantly making headline, but it\u2019s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the poll:\n\n\u2022More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either \u201cbelow average\u201d or \u201cvery poor\u201d health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13.

By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either \u201cabove average\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).\n\n\u2022Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton\u2019s potential medical issues.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she\u2019s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60\u2019s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually \u2018looking old\u2019 or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can\u2019t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary\u2019s health. The suspicion isn\u2019t from one particular thing, it\u2019s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.\n\nAt one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady\u2019s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting \u2018confused and needing naps\u2019, of which she was probably severely punished.\n\nAnd then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn\u2019t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.\n\n\n\nAnother of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.\n\n\n\nThen there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone\u2019s arm.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don\u2019t see her in person because she looks awful.\n\n\n\nAnd of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she\u2019s gasping for air.

Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court\u2019s help, Arizona\u2019s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver\u2014out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates.

Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.\n\nThe different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.\n\nAside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary\u2019s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.\n\nSince the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.\n\nThe question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?\n\nWhat we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.\n\nIt is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.\n\nIf anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.\n\nThe American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "file": "BuzzFeed_Fake_11-Webpage.json", "label": [0, 1]}, {"text": "A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night.

Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.

Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He\u2019s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.\n\nPuzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.\n\nPuzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don\u2019t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.\n\nYou can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating.

She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She\u2019s a liar.

Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now.

You can\u2019t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.\n\nIt\u2019s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment.

The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:\n\nI watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. \u2014 BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let\u2019s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot,\u201d Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.\n\n\u201cThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,\u201d Meyer told me almost breathlessly, \u201cI\u2019ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant \u2018hands up, don\u2019t shoot\u2019 and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter leaving \u2018The Epicenter,\u2019 police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful \u2013 and that\u2019s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.\u201d\n\nMeyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, \u201coh, absolutely.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a gunshot,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt was much louder. It wasn\u2019t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly \u2018They just shot him\u2019 and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn\u2019t already left, exited.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.\n\nIt took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was \u2018entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.\u2019\n\nCNN reports, \u201cPolice say the person was shot by a civilian.\u201d\n\nThe City of Charlotte began spinning the protester\u2019s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:\n\nALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. \u2014 City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016\n\nTwo additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police\u2019s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.\n\n\u201cI saw the man go down on the pavement,\u201d said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, \u201cIt was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.\u201d\n\n#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV \u2014 Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016\n\nLastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook \u2013 which was also shared via twitter \u2013 that, \u201cwithin 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet.

Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance.

Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.\n\nThe oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so.

While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I\u2019ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099\r\nThe reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.\r\n\r\nHowever, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.\r\n\r\nThis suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President\u2019s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.\r\n\r\nTimeline of Events:\r\nMarch 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal e-mail account while Secretary of State.\r\nMarch 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring preservation of all e-mails.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: Barack Obama states he only learned about the private e-mail server \u201cthrough news reports\u201d at the same time as everybody.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: 15:41:16 -0800 (PST) Cheryl Mills writes EMAIL ID 31077 as revealed by Podesta Emails Part 18: \u201cwe need to clean this up\u200a\u2014\u200ahe has emails from her\u200a\u2014\u200athey do not say state.gov.\u201d\r\nMarch 7, 2015: Hillary Surrogate Terry McCauliffe met with the FBI agent who oversaw the Clinton e-mail case and his wife and promised financial support ($500k+) if she ran for office.\u200a\u2014\u200aWall Street Journal\r\nMarch, 25\u201331, 2015: Paul Cobetta, a Platte River Networks employee, permanently and irreversibly deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit likely under orders from Cheryl Mills after receiving advice on Reddit on how to delete e-mails for a \u201cVIP\u201d. The evidence under congressional subpoena is completely destroyed, including the Presidents e-mails.", "file": "BuzzFeed_Fake_34-Webpage.json", "label": [0, 1]}, {"text": "Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation \u2013 where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners \u2013 the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed \u201cgood\u201d that the foundation has done over the years.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they\u2019re an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization\u2019s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and \u201cother expenses.\u201d The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization\u2019s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as \u201cother expenses,\u201d while the remaining almost $851K was marked as \u201cprofessional fundraising expenses.\u201d Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more \u201cother expenses\u201d in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com", "file": "BuzzFeed_Fake_7-Webpage.json", "label": [0, 1]}, {"text": "It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he\u2019d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.\r\n\r\nFirst, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn\u2019t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals\u2019 butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn\u2019t. He peeked into people\u2019s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns\u2019 desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music \u2014 the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans \u2014 and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they\u2019d seen. (\u201cHey, bro, it\u2019s the president!\u201d \u201cYeah, bro!\u201d) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word \u201cISIS\u201d came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He\u2019d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.\r\n\r\nAt first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn\u2019t kidding. \u201cI want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,\u201d he\u2019d tell them. They\u2019d laugh and say something like, \u201cHey, Mr. President, please don\u2019t ever say that again publicly!\u201d Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.\r\n\r\nThey were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other\u2019s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, \u201cIs it about how you\u2019re really a terrorist?\u201d He looked at her and said, \u201cYes, actually.\u201d She stopped eating her Popsicle. \u201cDonald Trump was right about you?\u201d He nodded. \u201cAbout everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He\u2019d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (\u201cHonestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.\u201d) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?\u201d Hillary asked. Obama nodded. \u201cKind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn\u2019t know what had given it away. He\u2019d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? \u201cWait, what?\u201d Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo\u2019s eyes were really tiny LED screens. \u201cDid you know that when Bo barks,\u201d Obama said, \u201che\u2019s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?\u201d Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m short-circuiting!\u201d Obama did his best to comfort her. \u201cBo does that sometimes. Then he\u2019ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman\u2019s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,\u201d Hillary apologized. \u201cDo you mean a fin?\u201d Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: \u201cBut I haven\u2019t even told you the best part yet. I\u2019m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsis?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, ISIS. All caps.\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn\u2019t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he\u2019d be. He told her \u201clike for real\u201d they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nHe was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until I\u2019m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.\u201d Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to \u201cWonderwall\u201d as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair.
