You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it\u2019s older because then you\u2019ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say \u201c\u2019Wow I didn\u2019t know Trump was that old.\u2019 Hey, she\u2019ll be unimpressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.\u201d\n\nAttacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.\n\n\"I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u2013 the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya \u2013 that never came up,\" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.\n\nTrump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.\n\n\u201cI just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,\" she said. \"You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.\"\n\nWhile the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.\n\n\u201cI had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don\u2019t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cMy microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.\u201d\n\nAsked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, \u201cDonald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.\"\n\n\u201cI know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl. This was many years ago, and found the girl and talked about her like she was mother Teresa and it wasn't quite that way, but that's okay.

She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever\u2019s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she\u2019s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.\n\nBut the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She\u2019s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.\n\nEveryone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box \u2014 running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He\u2019s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn\u2019t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn\u2019t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can\u2019t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.\n\nThese are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump\u2019s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday \u2014 but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?\n\n1. Does he actually know \u2014 or care to know \u2014 the basic information needed to competently run the country?\n\nOnly one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that\u2019s a candidate\u2019s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump \u2014 who swooned after Clinton\u2019s superb convention in Philly \u2014 has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He\u2019s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.\n\nHis resurgence proves three political points \u2014 two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and \u2014 lastly, but not leastly \u2014 Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.\n\nThe first debate should be a pivot \u2014 from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn\u2019t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule \u2014 and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won\u2019t happen, but a boy can dream.\n\nThis is not to suggest that Trump can\u2019t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he\u2019s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.\n\nTrump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs \u2014 apparently he wasn\u2019t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates \u2014 but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump\u2019s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn\u2019t aware of that fact, or just didn\u2019t care.\n\nThe caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. \u201cAll you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,\u201d said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. \u201cWhen you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.\u201d\n\nStone argued that Trump isn\u2019t an ignoramus \u2014 just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush\u2019s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush\u2019s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.\n\nTrump\u2019s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless \u2014 but there\u2019s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.\n\nMany Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD\u2019s Section 8 program is \u2014 and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don\u2019t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms \u2014 by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?\n\n2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?\n\nAgain, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: \u201cWe're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace \u2026 we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: \u201cFor more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d\n\nDuring a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for \u201cArticle 12 of the Constitution.\u201d The framers stopped at seven. \u201cHe was just listing out numbers,\u201d said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. \u201cI think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.\u201d\n\nOK, let\u2019s write that one off as a gotcha \u2014 you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where \u201csome bad things are happening.\u201d The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the \u201cFree Exercise\u201d clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.\n\n3. Why won\u2019t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?\n\nHillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs \u2014 and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.\n\nBut the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.\n\nWhy does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump\u2019s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he\u2019s \u201cvery, very rich.\u201d He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he\u2019s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he\u2019s worth less than half that much).\n\nMore serious is the issue of Trump\u2019s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that\u2019s a lie, there\u2019s an easy way to prove it \u2014 by releasing the returns.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.\n\n4. What\u2019s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there\u2019s the matter of Trump\u2019s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump\u2019s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.\n\nThe problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.\n\n5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.\n\nBut if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he\u2019s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.\n\nHillary Clinton (\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d in Trump\u2019s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint \u2014 far from it \u2014 and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.\n\nBut it\u2019s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness \u2014 especially George W. Bush\u2019s claims about Iraq \u2014 would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump\u2019s whoppers would take up too much space \u2013 read POLITICO\u2019s comprehensive \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths\u201d for a taste.)\n\nIn an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump\u2019s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. \u201cClinton,\u201d the former speaker wrote, \u201cis a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing\u2026\u201d\n\nBut getting the facts right \u2014 and telling the truth \u2014 is a big thing. It\u2019s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.\n\nAuthors:"}, {"label": [1, 0], "file": "BuzzFeed_Real_3-Webpage.json", "text": "Critical Counties is a CNN series exploring 11 counties around the country that chief national correspondent John King has identified as key in the 2016 election.

Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.\n\nThe latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the \u201ctoss up state\u201d category.\n\nDonald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump\u2019s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan\u2019s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent\u2019s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump\u2019s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent\u2019s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.\n\nDonald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York\u2019s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump\u2019s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump\u2019s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health following her fainting at last week\u2019s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump\u2019s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.\n\nTrump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something \u201cunpresidential\u201d. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could \u201cmess up his hair\u201d. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said \u201cyes\u201d to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the \u201cTrump Train\u201d. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it\u2019s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.\n\nNow if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed \u201ctwo years early and under budget\u201d, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the \u201cbirther issue\u201d. Trump took the microphone and said \u201cNot to mention her in the same breath,\u201d (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) \u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.

After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama\u2019s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.\n\nThey\u2019re not laughing anymore.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGoing into Monday night\u2019s debate, Obama\u2019s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn\u2019t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they\u2019re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they\u2019ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president\u2019s aides \u2013 current and former \u2013 now concede, they\u2019re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re maybe in the fifth season of \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 here. We\u2019re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,\u201d said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.\n\nPrivately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He\u2019s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it\u2019s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who\u2019ve benefited from his policies\u2014like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare\u2014support Democrats.\n\nFor Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump\u2019s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on \u2018hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there\u2019s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.\n\n\u201cWe are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,\u201d said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. \u201cBut we\u2019re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.\n\nAnd the result: Trump\u2019s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama\u2019s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.\n\nThough only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president\u2019s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama\u2019s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks it\u2019s his legacy, I don\u2019t think any of us think it\u2019s his legacy,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. \u201cTrumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.\u201d\n\nBut they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cI think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he\u2019s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. \u201cHe\u2019s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.\u201d\n\nFor any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, \u201cTrump has shattered that,\u201d Vietor said. \u201cHe has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a low blow, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not of substance. That\u2019s a bad lesson for people to learn.\u201d\n\nAccording to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he\u2019d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it\u2019s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.\n\n\u201cHe's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,\u201d said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.\n\nAnd Democrats\u2019 sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that\u2019s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.\n\n\u201cThe eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,\u201d said Earnest, \u201cis intellectually bankrupt\u2014or about something other than the economy.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,\u201d Papa said, \u201cthan have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.\u201d\n\nAuthors:"}, {"label": [1, 0], "file": "BuzzFeed_Real_77-Webpage.json", "text": "The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said that 858 people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship. | AP Photo U.S. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants\n\nAt least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general announced Monday.\n\nThe mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI\u2019s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships.

There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a \u201cpressure cooker\u201d device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.\n\nGiven that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism.

And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn\u2019t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the \u201cbad guys.\u201d Unfortunately, our leadership \u2013 who ostensibly wants to protect us \u2013 finds their hands and their tongues tied.

James O\u2019Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York\u2019s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word \u201cterrorism\u201d is defined. \u201cA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.\u201d Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his \u201cobvious\u201d assessment?\n\nThe two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that \u201cwe need to do everything we can to support our first responders \u2013 also to pray for the victims\u201d and that \u201cwe need to let this investigation unfold.\u201d Trump was more direct. \u201cI must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut boy we are living in a time\u2014we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It\u2019s a terrible thing that\u2019s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as \u201csoft targets.\u201d Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com"}, {"label": [1, 0], "file": "BuzzFeed_Real_21-Webpage.json", "text": "The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Manhattan is investigating Anthony Weiner\u2019s alleged sexting with a minor, according to two officials briefed on the case.\n\nAn inquiry was opened, although no formal complaint has been filed.

He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nA U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.\n\nFormer classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.\n\nOne of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a \"pretty normal guy.\" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.\n\nRahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nThe Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.\n\n\"I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,\" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. \"He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.\"\n\nMembers of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.\n\nInvestigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nIn August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer \"has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,\" but Rahami was not indicted.\n\nToday Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.\n\nLate Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million.

Polling averages now show that Clinton\u2019s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a \u201cdead heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,\u201d Silver tweeted.\n\nDuring the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton\u2019s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,\u201d Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, \u201cthat that simply be checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nBut Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump\u2019s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he\u2019s a Democrat and the system is \u201cvery unfair.\u201d The \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that he knew what Lester Holt\u2019s voter registration was,\u201d said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. \u201cHe didn\u2019t lie,\u201d Conway said at one point, explaining that \u201ca lie would mean that he knew the man\u2019s party registration.\u201d\n\nIn a presidential cycle that\u2019s seen endless debates about debates, Monday\u2019s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn\u2019t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s campaign has beat up on Holt\u2019s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump\u2019s false assertion that he didn\u2019t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.\n\nView One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nThe nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. \u201cIn our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,\u201d Janet Brown, the commission\u2019s executive director, told CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Clinton won\u2019t let Trump\u2019s lies \u201cgo by the wayside,\u201d press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn\u2019t, either.\n\n\u201cThere is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,\u201d he said. \u201cLester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates\u2019 performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can\u2019t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.\n\n\u201cI think what the concern is from both of the campaigns \u2014 and what it should be \u2014 is that the moderator is not the person who\u2019s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can hold people accountable, there\u2019s no question, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they\u2019re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp\u2019s preparation for two Trumps.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Donald Trump\u2019s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We\u2019re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,\u201d Mook told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nAsked about Clinton\u2019s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that \u201cit just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nView One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nBut Conway shot down the notion that there\u2019s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is \u201cto become human\u201d during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that \u201cOverprogramming leads to short circuits,\u201d and Conway joined the pile-on.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven\u2019t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.\u201d\n\nAfter Mook warned against \u201ca double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,\u201d Conway added that the two campaign managers \u201care living in parallel universes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it\u2019s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn\u2019t necessarily been beneficial.\u201d\n\nAside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton\u2019s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they\u2019re conclusions in search of evidence,\u201d Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.\n\n\u201cWhat I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,\u201d Conway said. \u201cNinety-two percent of at least two of our embeds\u2019 tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can\u2019t get a fair shake from certain people.\u201d\n\nConway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cSo if she ends up saying to him, \u2018That\u2019s just not true, you\u2019re distorting my record, you\u2019re being mean to a woman,\u2019 and then people will say, \u2018He was mean to a woman,\u2019 and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up \u2014 even if it\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that would be my concern, that he\u2019s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she\u2019s not a great debater, that she\u2019s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she\u2019s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to \"just let loose\" and be himself \u2014 and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.\n\n\"She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,\" Giuliani said on \"Fox and Friends.\" \"So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be \u2014 he's just going to be like you see him on \u2014 when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone.

I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps.\n\nThis year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.\n\nHere it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today\u2019s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.\n\nNor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at \u201cregime change.\u201d She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as \u201canother Hitler.\u201d She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.\n\nIn fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America\u2019s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.\n\nThat candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.\n\nIt must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin\u2019s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did\u2014an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin \u201ckilling Russians,\u201d a doubly illegal act of war.\n\nMoreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.\n\n***\n\nJohn Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, \u201cAbove all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.\u201d Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.\n\nBut within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our \u201cstrategy of peace,\u201d he said, was \u201cnot a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.\u201d Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that \u201cour most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children\u2019s future. And we are all mortal.\u201d As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, \u201cwe must reexamine our own attitude\u2014as individuals and as a nation\u2014for our attitude is as essential as theirs.\u201d\n\nSix months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.\n\n\u201cOur brave young men,\u201d he said, \u201care dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.\u201d\n\nHe also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. \u201cAll this is our responsibility,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just a nation\u2019s responsibility but yours and mine.\u201d\n\nJohn and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.\n\nThe legacy of JFK & RFK is \u201cbeing abandoned by today\u2019s Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nTheirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today\u2019s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.\n\nScores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America\u2019s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.\n\nMost amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself\u2014as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.\n\nWhere are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime \u201cexistential\u201d threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be \u201cexistential\u201d enemy.\n\nThere are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, \u201con the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.\u201d\n\nSurely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.\n\nBut, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.\n\nFor the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.\n\nAnd they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.\n\n***\n\nSo my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.\n\nWe must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.\n\nPresident Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children\u2019s future.\n\nSecond, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.\n\nBut nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.\n\nDonald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, \u201cAmerica first.\u201d But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.\n\nFinally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, \u201cThere can be no business as usual with Russia.\u201d\n\nSurely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.\n\nAnd therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:\n\nReturn to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.\n\nDo not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.\n\nCommit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.\n\nThis, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.\n\nWell may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.\n\nFlawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.\n\nTruly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.\n\nAdam Walinsky worked in the Department of Justice during the Kennedy administration and later served as legislative assistant and speechwriter to Sen.

He didn\u2019t go that route.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOf Trump\u2019s statement on Obama\u2019s birthplace, Arpaio added: \u201cIt didn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nArpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama\u2019s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.\n\nTrump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States \u2014 a claim the president\u2019s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.\n\nBut while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama\u2019s birth certificate was forged.

She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump\u2019s vision.\n\nAs he made clear once again in Monday night\u2019s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms\u2014when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC\u2019s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was \u201cone of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once\u2014as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton\u2019s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. \u2018I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,\u201d she said. \u201cIncomes went up for everybody.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. \u201cMy whole life is about winning. \u2026 I always win,\u201d Trump says in explaining why he\u2019s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric \u201cWinning the Global Competition.\u201d You don\u2019t get more zero-sum than that.\n\nDespite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game\u2014but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone\u2019s welfare at once\u2013Trump\u2019s message has resonated in an era when it\u2019s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.\n\nThe recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.\n\nHence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they\u2019ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.\n\nNo, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of \u201cwinners\u201d without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan\u2019s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.\n\nHillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description \u2013 clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially \u2013 support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.\n\n***\n\nIs either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children\u2019s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.\n\nThe voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it\u2019s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders\u2019 powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a \u201ccross of gold.\u201d Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.\n\nTrump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven\u2019t lack for economic benefits in today\u2019s world. They aren\u2019t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.\n\nWe have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.\n\nZachary Karabell is head of global strategy at Envestnet and author of The Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World.

Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks \u2014 \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he says \u2014 to largely white audiences.\n\nAt the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.\n\nSeated to Trump\u2019s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (\u201cthere\u2019s only one,\u201d Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (\u201ctough\u201d), retired Lt. Gen.

America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times \u2013 because we\u2019ve had some tough times \u2013 but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.\n\n\u201cEveryday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag.\n\n\u201cWe all have to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.\n\n\u201cMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen.

Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.\n\n\u201cShe shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat \u2014 who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. \u201cHillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,\u201d a New Hampshire Democrat added. \u201cPresidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.\u201d\n\nOne Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,\u201d said the Ohio Democrat. \u201cShe will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.\n\n\u201cSomehow she needs to reverse the trend,\u201d said an Ohio Republican. \u201cNever seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance \u2014 and maybe her last chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has to stop [Trump\u2019s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,\u201d added a Virginia Republican. \u201cAll [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.\u201d\n\nAmong those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure \u2014 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans \u2014 most pointed to the GOP nominee\u2019s volatile personality.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,\u201d said a Michigan Republican. \u201cThe pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?\u201d added a Michigan Democrat. \u201cCan he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?\u201d\n\nTwo other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:\n\nMost insiders expect Clinton to \u201cwin\u201d the debate.\n\nMajorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.\n\n\u201cMedia look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,\u201d said an Iowa Republican.\n\n\u201c[Clinton\u2019s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,\u201d added a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\nBut not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton \u2014 or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.\n\n\u201cThe press wants Trump to win,\u201d said a Florida Democrat. \u201cTheir disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans also claimed media bias \u2014 in the other direction.\n\n\u201cThe media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,\u201d a Virginia Republican said. \u201cBut then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.\u201d\n\nInsiders think the debate will matter.\n\nAsked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.\n\nAmong Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don\u2019t expect the debate to move the needle.\n\n\u201cTrump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),\u201d a Michigan Democrat predicted. \u201cThe moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.\u201d\n\nThe numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn\u2019t have a significant impact.\n\n\u201cTrump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,\u201d said a New Hampshire Republican. \u201cHe does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump\u2019s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.\n\n\u201cIf she pins his ears back, [it helps her],\u201d said an Iowa Republican. \u201cIf it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.\u201d\n\nOther insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.\n\n\u201cWe're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,\u201d an Iowa Republican said. \u201cSwing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.\u201d\n\nAdded a Florida Democrat: \u201cDoes a damn thing matter this year?

The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure \u2014 they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can\u2019t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it\u2019s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty\u2026 you know, for \u201csafety\u201d.\n\nTuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. \u201cWe can only realize the promise of this institution\u2019s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions.

How this will make the country safer, he didn\u2019t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. \u201cUltimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer \u2014 it\u2019s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.\n\nHow allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it\u2019s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn\u2019t make us safer, either. It\u2019s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights.

I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.\u201d\n\nThe veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.\n\nSuffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.\n\nThe last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B.

Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.\n\nThe House and Senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. A veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the White House says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough Democrats to block the override effort.\n\nObama's former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election."}, {"label": [1, 0], "file": "BuzzFeed_Real_15-Webpage.json", "text": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.\n\nThe two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.\n\nHere are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:\n\n1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.\n\nWhen Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents\u2019 trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, \u201cHow are you, Donald?\u201d Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.\n\nShortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, \u201cBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,\u201d before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, \u201cYes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to be referring to his addressing her as \u201cSecretary Clinton,\u201d although it wasn\u2019t completely clear during the moment.\n\n2. Personal Attacks Came Early\n\nClinton was first to go on the attack during tonight\u2019s debate, taking aim at Trump\u2019s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.\n\n\u201cDonald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,\u201d Clinton said, before expanding on her father\u2019s work as a drapery maker.\n\nTrump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in \u201ctrumped up, trickle-down\u201d economics.\n\n\u201cFor one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.\n\n3. Trading Barbs Over Trade\n\nVoters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nTrump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.\n\n\u201cAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nClinton fired back, \u201cWell, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.\u201d\n\nTrump then pointed to Clinton\u2019s once referring to TPP as the \u201cgold standard of trade deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, \"TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\u201d Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that \u201cwhat I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.\u201d\n\n4. Trump Asks \u2018Why Not\u2019 Blame All the World\u2019s Problems on Clinton\n\nLess than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: \"I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nClinton responded: \"Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this\u2014\u201c\n\nTrump interjected: \"There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,\u201d before the moderator reminded Trump, \"This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\"\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns\n\nTrump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cI don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,\u201d he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.\n\nTrump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. \u201cI will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?\n\n\u201cMaybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,\u201d she said.\n\n6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage\n\nModerator Lester Holt asked Trump \u201cwhat took you so long\u201d to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee\u2019s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.\n\nAt first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was \u201csatisfied\u201d with when Obama released his birth certificate.\n\nHolt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it\u2019s authenticity until 2015.\n\n\u201cNobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,\u201d Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump\u2019s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. \u201cI figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.\u201d\n\nPaul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\n7. Clinton Defends Being \u2018Prepared\u2019 When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail\n\nTrump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,\u201d seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight\u2019s faceoff.\n\n\"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,\u201d Clinton said. \"And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\u201d\n\nThroughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.\n\n8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion\n\nTrump\u2019s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.\n\n\u201cStop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that \u201cit went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would have won an appeal,\u201d he said, noting that there was no appeal.\n\nTrump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.\n\n9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope\n\nToward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.\n\n\u201cI did not support the war in Iraq,\u201d Trump said. \"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\u201d\n\nHolt corrected him, saying, \u201cThe record shows otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, \u201cAre you for invading Iraq?\"\n\nTrump appeared to hesitate, responding, \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d\n\nDespite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, \u201cThe record shows that I am right.\u201d\n\n10. Sparring Over Stamina\n\nHolt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a \u201cpresidential look,\u201d asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her \u201cstamina.\u201d\n\n\"She doesn't have the look, she doesn\u2019t have the stamina,\u201d Trump said. \"I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\u201d\n\nTrump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.\n\n\"Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nShe also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:\n\n\"One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,\u201d Clinton said. \"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\u201d"}, {"label": [1, 0], "file": "BuzzFeed_Real_29-Webpage.json", "text": "\"Donald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward,\" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him\n\nTwo months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party\u2019s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.\n\nThat declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly \u2014 in part responding to Trump\u2019s attacks on his wife and father.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump\u2019s tax returns could show a mob connection\n\nIn February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn\u2019t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d suggesting that they might show \u201cDonald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there\u2019s a bombshell there,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to wonder, \u2018Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?\u2019\u201d\n\n2. In March, Cruz called him a \u201csniveling coward\u201d\n\nSpeaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on the senator\u2019s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, \u201cDonald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to tick me off. I don\u2019t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that\u2019ll do it every time,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n3. He also called Trump a \u201cbig, loud New York bully\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,\u201d Cruz said . \u201cIt is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.\u201d\n\n4. Also, \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.\u201d\n\n5. Cruz called one of Trump\u2019s theories \u201cnuts\u201d and \u201cjust kooky\u201d\n\nIn May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz\u2019s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: \u201cThis morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let\u2019s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.\u201d\n\n6. He also called him a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who \u201clies practically every word that comes out of his mouth\u201d\n\nAlso in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.\u201d\n\n7. And Cruz was specific with the term \u201cpathological\u201d: Trump is \u201cutterly amoral,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cI say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he\u2019d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he\u2019s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,\u201d Cruz said .\n\n8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d\n\nContinuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : \u201cHe combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country\u2019s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, \u2018Dude, what\u2019s your problem?\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd: \u201cDonald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He\u2019s proud of being a serial philanderer.\u201d\n\n9. In July, Cruz still hadn\u2019t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family\n\n\u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,\u201d Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.\n\nReferring to his pledge to support his party\u2019s nominee, Cruz said that statement \u201cwas not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog\" and support him.\n\nAuthors:"}, {"label": [1, 0], "file": "BuzzFeed_Real_24-Webpage.json", "text": "Friday morning around 4:00, three men \u2013 some of whom were armed \u2013 barged in through one of the doors of an Atlanta resident\u2019s house.

Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I\u2019m pretty much baffled.\n\nThe problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses\u2014especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: \u201cYou\u2019ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you\u2019re one of those who\u2019s created the mess we\u2019re in.\u201d So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIndeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I\u2019ve called \u201cpolitical judo\u201d\u2014turning an opponent\u2019s strength against her. (\u201cYes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that\u2019s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy\u2019s chief speechwriter, are backing me.\u201d)\n\nFurther, there's a sense\u2014a highly limited sense\u2014in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, \u201cI'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.\u201d It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).\n\nBy contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers\u2014assuming they exist\u2014to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump\u2014bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post\u2014but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump\u2014and he's still standing.\n\nDoes any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don\u2019t do, based on a half-century or so of history.\n\nThe Focus Is on \u201cMoments\u201d\u2014But They\u2019re Not Always The Key\n\nAsk any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:\n\n\u201cNixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter \u2018there you go again,\u2019 then asked Americans \u2018are you better off?\u2019 Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale\u2019s \u2018youth and inexperience.\u2019 Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife\u2019s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.\u201d\n\nThese are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It\u2019s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines\u2014\u201czingers\u201d\u2014to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It\u2019s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, \u201cYou\u2019ve all become theater critics.\u201d)\n\nBut in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it\u2019s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the \u201daha!\u201d moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama\u2019s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president\u2019s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.\n\nThe presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a \u201cmoment\u201d unlike any in debate history; that\u2019s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: \u201che seemed pretty reasonable\u201d or \u201cshe knows what she\u2019s talking about and he doesn\u2019t.\u201d This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.\n\nThere Are Three Debates, Not One\u2014And That Can Matter A Whole Lot\n\nOne key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th\u2014barely a week before the election.\n\nEvery other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That\u2019s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it\u2019s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.\n\nHere, I think, is an opening for Clinton\u2014especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question\u2014and they are usually very lame \"what can you do for my daughter?\" questions\u2014into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump\u2019s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush\u2019s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: \"What about Dingell-Norwood?\" The opportunity for her is to argue\u2014from experience\u2014that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format\u2014with dozens of \u201creal\u201d people as participants\u2014makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).\n\nTrump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo\n\nThe potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthey've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.\u201d\n\nJudo, however, can cut both ways. There\u2019s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.\n\n\u201cWell, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don\u2019t know because you\u2019re the first presidential candidate ever who won\u2019t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who\u2019s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn\u2019t start with millions from his father, says you\u2019re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit\u2014you\u2019re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.\u201d\n\nDebates Are NOT Decisive\n\nOne last note. It\u2019s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (\u201cReagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.\u201d \u201cObama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected\u2026\u201d). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama\u2019s clear if modest popular vote victory.\n\nIn their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H. Sides and Lynn Vavreck tried to measure the impact of debates, gaffes, and other \u201cgame-changers\u201d with real-time public opinion measurements. What they found was that even a dramatic event like Romney\u2019s first debate performance had a relative small, and relatively short-lived, impact. Compared to the \u201cfundamentals\u201d\u2014economic performance and the ever-growing impact of a polarized electorate\u2014the stuff of which a hundred overwrought post-debate analyses are made may be of only marginal significance.\n\nOf course, this cycle the \u201cfundamentals\u201d point to a very close race. So you\u2019ll probably want to tune in anyway\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author."}, {"label": [1, 0], "file": "BuzzFeed_Real_44-Webpage.json", "text": "External links are provided for reference purposes.

One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.\n\nThree other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can\u2019t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.\n\nFrom the Daily Mail:\n\nNational Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area \u2013 including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy \u2013 all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.\n\nA number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.\n\nOn Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, \u201cStop \u2013 that\u2019s not what this is about,\u201d as young men broke bottles in the street.\n\nAfter a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.\n\nA riot is an uncontrollable beast\u2026 once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues.

There were just five, though he said, \u201cI have quite a few more.\u201d The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, \u201cCarter Page, PhD.\u201d\n\nWho?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nReporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump\u2019s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he \u201cwill be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.\u201d\n\nThis piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this guy\u2019s name?\u201d says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.\n\n\u201cI had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,\u201d says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. \u201cBut I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, \u2018Have you heard of this guy?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cStrangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,\u201d Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. \u201cIt's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.\u201d\n\nSomeone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who\u2019d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.\n\nThis has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. \u201cI\u2019m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,\" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. \"We want top-of-the-line professionals.\u201d As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn\u2019t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that \u201cHugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.\u201d) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?\n\nEnter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (\u201cI can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?\u2019\u201d says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump\u2019s own campaign.\n\nWhat I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,\u201d says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil giant. \u201cPeople really respect him in this industry. He\u2019s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.\u201d According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials\u2014including Rosneft head Igor Sechin\u2014during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it\u2019s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.\n\nPage has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his \u201cdeep ties\u201d with \u201cexecutives at Gazprom,\u201d the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with \u201cextensive business interests in Russia\u201d and an office \u201caround the corner from Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nPage has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School\u2019s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, \u201cWashington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\u201d He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a \u201cfamous American economist\u201d and \u201cadviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAll of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of \u201cinsiders,\u201d people who seem to be in Trump\u2019s orbit but who may not have\u2014and may never have had\u2014any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.\n\nBut someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate \u201ccorporate investigators\u201d digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won\u2019t say who turned him on to Page\u2019s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin\u2019s chief of staff\u2014both of whom are on the sanctions list\u2014when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.\n\nSo the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?\n\n***\n\nI should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn\u2019t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page\u2019s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.\n\nThis was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.\n\nOK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn\u2019t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nPage\u2019s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. \u201cHe spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,\u201d his bio reads. \u201cHe was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.\u201d\n\nThose were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page\u2019s tenure in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.\n\nSo I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn\u2019t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn\u2019t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch\u2019s purported involvement in the deal. \u201cI don\u2019t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,\u201d says Craig . \u201cIt closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page\u2019s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, \u201cI rolled my eyes at that one.\u201d (He, too, said he hadn\u2019t heard of Page until Trump\u2019s announcement.)\n\nFine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?\n\nTurns out, they did.\n\n\u201cHis nickname was stranichkin,\u201d from the Russian word stranichka, or \u201clittle page,\u201d says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company\u2019s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. \u201cIt really irritated our team,\u201d Torchinsky told me over Skype. \u201cWe worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we\u2019d have to correct them. These guys didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.\u201d As for Page, \u201cHe made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,\u201d Torchinsky says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.\u201d\n\nOK, harsh. But then I talked to Page\u2019s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t great and he wasn\u2019t terrible,\u201d Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone \u201cwithout any special talents or accomplishments,\u201d someone who was \u201ca gray spot.\u201d \u201cWhat can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?\u201d he asked me.\n\nPage was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was \u201cjust the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,\u201d says Aleksashenko.\n\nWhen it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page \u201cwas not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.\u201d When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, \u201cmildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.\u201d And, says Aleksashenko, \u201cjudging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn\u2019t really understand the topic.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, \u201cdid not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,\u201d says Aleksashenko.\n\n***\n\nFor the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. \u201cIn recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.\u201d He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West\u2019s \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and the \u201cartist\u2019s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs\u201d but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (\u201cSlave; Pronunciation: /sl\u0101v/\u2026\u201d), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.\n\nHis speech in Moscow\u2019s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word \u201cironically.\u201d \u201cFor the last 15 years, I\u2019ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,\u201d he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn\u2019t really speak Russian\u2014he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: \u201cWe never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.\u201d Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.\n\nPage also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. \u201cHe had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn\u2019t really want to engage,\u201d one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. \u201cThat blog post about the slaves. That\u2019s just \u2026 strange,\u201d says the Council member.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn\u2019t be in the last decile, but he\u2019d be in the second-to-last decile,\u201d says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. \u201cYou\u2019d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI should\u2019ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign\u2019s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump\u2019s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page\u2019s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.\n\nI was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page\u2019s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia\u2019s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?\n\nBut it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch\u2019s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. \u201cNo one let him into Gazprom,\u201d Aleksashenko says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller\u2019s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.\u201d Another of Page\u2019s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page\u2019s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. \u201cPeople organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,\u201d the former colleague said. \u201cHe hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year\u2026 I used to do this; it doesn\u2019t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re close to him.\u201d\n\nBut the meetings did provide him with something else. \u201cGazprom didn\u2019t need money at the time,\u201d says the former colleague. \u201cThey were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.\u201d Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he\u2019s worked for to invest in them.\n\nAfter Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father\u2019s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as \u201cfounder and managing partner,\u201d even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address\u2014that\u2019s the one \u201caround the corner from Trump Tower\u201d\u2014 which was actually the address of a co-working space.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Carter Page,\u201d says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he\u2019s been trying to throw together these deals. He\u2019s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.\u201d\n\nIn the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know this person,\u201d said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page\u2019s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. \u201cI give them money, I don\u2019t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,\u201d he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, \u201cDon\u2019t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are engaged in onanism,\u201d said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It\u2019s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nAs for the FBI investigation, well, it\u2019s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is \u201cno prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.\u201d He added, \u201cthe story doesn't add up.\u201d What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page\u2019s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, \u201cwhether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.\n\n\u201cHe has no formal role in the campaign,\u201d Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.\n\nNow my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks\u2019s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?\n\nOne way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.\n\nOne source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump\u2019s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. \u201cThe only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,\u201d Burt told me. \u201cAnd I told him I\u2019d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I\u2019ve forgotten. He\u2019s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?\u201d\n\nSomeone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump\u2019s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn\u2019t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. \u201cIf he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,\u201d this person told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not answering your questions,\u201d Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s other spokesperson, says, \u201cCarter Page isn\u2019t someone I\u2019ve interacted with.\u201d Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: \u201cCarter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He\u2019s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWas Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said\u2014he\u2019s my adviser\u2014and what his associates said\u2014\u201cWho?\u201d Maybe I wasn\u2019t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about his Russia fund, other than it\u2019s never really materialized,\u201d says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. \u201cEvery conversation I\u2019ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They\u2019ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.\u201d He went on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t name a project that I could connect Carter\u2019s name to, any project that actually happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s earned a living off this,\u201d the energy player says, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it\u2019s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.\u201d\n\nStrangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, \u201ca lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, \u2018I want to be part of the team,\u2019\u201d says the Trump adviser. And that\u2019s how it happened. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, \u2018He\u2019s an adviser.\u2019 And now he\u2019s milking it for all it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nNow, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington\u2014or at least could plausibly market himself as one. \u201cI was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,\u201d one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there \u201cin a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,\u201d but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen\u2014and be impressed. \u201cHe was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,\u201d the Russia specialist recalls. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.\u201d\n\nAccording to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page\u2019s trip to Russia, \u201cthe meetings did happen and that\u2019s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.\u201d But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. \u201cIt\u2019s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?\u201d said the staffer. \u201cIs he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America\u2019s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It\u2019s what\u2019s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?\u201d\n\nThis seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he\u2019s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is\u2014and to try to turn a profit off of that. \u201cIf Page using his status as \u2018Trump advisor\u2019 for personal gain, that\u2019s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!\u201d Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia\u2019s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy\u2014but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: \u201cCarter Page, Ph.D.\u201d Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.\n\nFor months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin\u2019s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? \u201cI want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,\u201d Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election\u2014as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we\u2019ve finally grasped it.\n\nJulia Ioffe is contributing writer at Politico Magazine."}, {"label": [1, 0], "file": "BuzzFeed_Real_10-Webpage.json", "text": "Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.\n\n\"If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,\" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon.

How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities?

They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.\n\nTrump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.\n\nDuring a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, \"We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,\"\n\nMany African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.\n\nTrump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.\n\n\"I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,\" said Trump. \"We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.\"\n\nBut this morning in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the \"violent disruptor\" and the rest of the black community.

In the very least, it\u2019s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.\n\nTogether, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we\u2019ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.\n\nToday\u2019s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.\n\nFor the left, it\u2019s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche\u2019s Twitter account this morning, I couldn\u2019t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:\n\nClearly when you\u2019re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When \u201cliberals\u201d \u2014 otherwise known as \u201csane people\u201d \u2014 try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we\u2019re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It\u2019s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.\n\nThe Supreme Court has sided with those \u201cliberals\u201d every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I\u2019ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I\u2019ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.\n\nFeatured image by Gage Skidmore"}]
