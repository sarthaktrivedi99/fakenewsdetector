Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it\u2019s was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton\u2019s schedule.\n\nInteresting fact\u2026.I just searched Hillary Clinton\u2019s rally events scheduled between September 20 \u2013 October 19 \u2013 She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn\u2019t list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!\n\nThere are many questions about her health, and admittedly I\u2019m no expert. However I am a realist.\n\nI recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton\u2019s left hand.\n\nI further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.\n\nFurther rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn\u2019t appear to want to be president any longer.\n\nNo matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton\u2019s health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won\u2019t be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the \u201cconspirators.\u201d\n\nWorse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.\n\nExpect lots more on this to surface over the next few days.",

The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.

That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we?\n\nNow it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold\u2026 whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?\n\nFrom Jihad Watch:\n\nIt isn\u2019t news that the Islamic State has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves \u2013 especially Yazidi girls \u2013 but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of IS are being \u201csold in horrifying auctions to UK ally Saudi Arabia.\u201d An eyewitness reported: \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the Islamic State\u2019s practice of enslaving kafir women: The Islamic State\u2019s human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be \u2018kafir\u2019, non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin.\n\nAs these women are \u2018rescued\u2019 from ISIS, they are not being given freedom. They are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. These are the people that Hillary Clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. Monsters of a feather.\n\nI have said for a long time, not only are the Saudis sponsoring ISIS, so are the Russians. We are being played. Our own president is complicit. Let\u2019s not elect another corrupt demon who cares nothing of women and children being sold to rapists. After all, Hillary Clinton is married to one.",

This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn\u2019t to any stranger this time it was to his wife.\n\nHe had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.\n\nThe story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren\u2019t supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.\n\nThank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a \u2018disobedient\u2019 woman.

This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims which he is following.",

It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president\u2019s astounding incompetence, there\u2019s also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.\n\nThe General went on to explain; \"Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,\" Odierno said. \"Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.\"\n\nThe Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component. Investment in modernization is down by 25%, Odierno said, sidelining \"much-needed\" infantry fighting vehicle modernization and a scout helicopter development program.",

With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers.

The idiots there turned a \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.\n\nGo figure. They can\u2019t even play the race card on this one, but they\u2019ll still wreck a town for no reason.\n\nIt makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?\n\nNothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.\n\nDing ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn\u2019t listen to police.\n\nThat must mean it\u2019s time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don\u2019t even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.\n\nMadworld News \u2013 Rioters swarmed this man\u2019s injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It\u2019s okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don\u2019t know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn\u2019t be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.\n\nIf I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I\u2019d probably pick them up.

They call white people racist just because they\u2019re white. They attack people just because they\u2019re white.\n\nThey call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can\u2019t. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.\n\nI judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.\n\nBased off what I\u2019ve seen so far, I can proudly say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on.",

	"text": "A Daisy of a Rerun\n\nI am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.\n\nThe year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson \u201capproved\u201d that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly \u201cwar mongering\u201d opponent, Barry Goldwater.\n\nToday, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson\u2019s deceitful war policies, Goldwater\u2019s vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation\u2019s media.\n\nI mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.\n\nObviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a \u201cDaisy\u201d remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.\n\nSomehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater\u2019s 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.\n\nInstead, today\u2019s voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as \u201cnews and views.\u201d With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media\u2019s reaction of ridicule was to be expected.\n\nNow, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted\u2019s \u201cdramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.\u201d This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d and \u201cutterly amoral.\u201d\n\nAs the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of \u201c\u2019Lyin Ted,\u2019 insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.\u201d These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.\n\nSchools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?\n\nAnother safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say \u201cderogatory\u201d when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the \u201cliberal press\u201d moniker has now everyday acceptance.\n\nIt is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public\u2019s re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.\n\nAlso, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.\n\nThese quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.\n\nWith that, consider the President\u2019s past considerations of today\u2019s democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, \u201cShe will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can\u2019t be trusted and isn\u2019t qualified to be President.\u201d\n\nObviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it\u2019s damning, given the time frame.\n\nAlso during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: \u201cIf you can\u2019t run your own house, you certainly can\u2019t run the White House.\u201d\n\nApparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.\n\nAgain, wouldn\u2019t it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

And then the group\u2019s Director, Perry O\u2019Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His \u2018Iraq Veterans Against the War\u2019 bio describes him:\n\nPerry O\u2019Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe PAC that\u2019s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O\u2019Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called \u201cTell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.\u201d The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O\u2019Brien to start the shallow PAC.

One of the most famous is probably \u201cread my lips\u2026no new taxes,\u201d a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases.

The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn\u2019t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. \u201cDestroy\u201d doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty \u201cyeeeeehaw,\u201d the reality is that he\u2019s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He\u2019s talking about profiling Muslims. He\u2019s talking about Donald Trump\u2019s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn\u2019t just a Muslim, he\u2019s an\n\nThe man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn\u2019t just a Muslim, he\u2019s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he\u2019s a suspect in a bombing doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked \u201ckill\u201d and not on the most wanted list. There\u2019s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.\n\nWhat that means is that under Trump\u2019s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I\u2019m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn\u2019t about the narrative. It isn\u2019t about prevention or education.\n\nIt\u2019s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.\n\nThe only solace we have is that what he\u2019s promising is nothing but another \u201cread my lips.\u201d Terrorism isn\u2019t something you can simply \u201cdestroy\u201d just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn\u2019t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.\n\nFeatured image from file",

I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That\u2019s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning.

She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,\n\n\u201cIf I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.\u201d\n\nThese comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin\u2019s Sunday elections. She also said,\n\n\u201cIf I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.\u201d\n\nShe took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.\n\nThe results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.\n\nRegardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.\n\nHowever, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.\n\nMerkel stated,\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany\u2019s. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.\u201d\n\nChristian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,\n\n\u201cIt is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.\u201d\n\nThe growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it.\n\nThis could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama\u2019s and Hillary Clinton\u2019s. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand her.",

	"text": "13.8k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nS Trump\u2019s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company\u2019s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.\n\nSources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment\u2019s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump\u2019s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. \u201cThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,\u201d the lawsuit says.\n\nIronically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee\u2019s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel\u2019s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he\u2019s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.\n\nThiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan\u2019s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire\u2019s then-secret sexual orientation.\n\nBut now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP\u2019s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, \u201cEvery American has a unique identity. I\u2019m proud to be gay, I\u2019m proud to be a Republican,\u201d after a lengthy rant against \u201cgovernment incompetence.\u201d He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.\n\nUnfortunately, his own party didn\u2019t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.\n\n\u201cFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,\u201d said the Department of Labor\u2019s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. \u201cOur nation\u2019s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.\u201d Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself \u201cvigorously\u201d and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.\n\nNow, the executive who accused his employer \u2013 the federal government \u2013 of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company\u2019s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

It\u2019s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin\u2019s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.\n\nPutin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: \u201chumourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.\u201d\n\nSo remember \u2013 don\u2019t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section.

This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable \u2013 except by Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:\n\nWhile on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics \u2026. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.\n\nAfter Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:\n\nFor the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator \u2026 to call out those lies and to do that in real time.\n\nUnfortunately, with Trump\u2019s impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it\u2019s somehow up to Hillary Clinton to \u201cshine\u201d at the debate if she hopes to \u201cwin.\u201d This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.\n\nHopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.\n\nIf there is one thing this election has shown us, it\u2019s that journalism is dying, if not already dead.\n\nFeatured image via Sara D.

Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.\n\nThe different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.\n\nAside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary\u2019s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.\n\nSince the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.\n\nThe question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?\n\nWhat we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.\n\nIt is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.\n\nIf anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.\n\nThe American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.\n\nDuring his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.\n\nObama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he\u2019s enjoying that Gilligan\u2019s Island by himself.\n\nHow ridiculous!

	"text": "Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.\r\n\r\nLast year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, \"especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year.\" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015\r\n\r\nThe story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.\r\n\r\nAccording to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's \"rigorous fact-checking\" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the \"birther moment\" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.\r\n\r\nSo, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.\r\n\r\nSo, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies.",

	"text": "BREAKING: Judge DEMANDS Release Of Clinton\u2019s Security Training Files \u2013 She Has 5 Days\u2026\n\nJust like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that\u2019s no joke. They shouldn\u2019t be cleared to clean a toilet there.\n\nThe Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn\u2019t do. It\u2019s called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nA frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department\u2019s motion to dismiss TheDCNF\u2019s Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF\u2019s request to depose State Department officials. \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.\n\nHuma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don\u2019t look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail\u2026 guess we just aren\u2019t the \u2018right people\u2019.\n\nJudge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said \u201cJudge Leon\u2019s Order made clear his frustration with the State Department\u2019s continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.\u201d I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It\u2019s getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is \u2018corruption\u2019.\n\nState Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the \u201ccourses were not completed\u201d by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh. That\u2019s for peons, not the elite evidently.",

	"text": "978 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nI don\u2019t recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton\u2019s health constantly making headline, but it\u2019s also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.\n\nHere are the top takeaways from the poll:\n\n\u2022More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either \u201cbelow average\u201d or \u201cvery poor\u201d health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That\u2019s a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.\n\n\u2022The share of voters who think Clinton\u2019s health is \u201caverage\u201d remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either \u201cabove average\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).\n\n\u2022Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton\u2019s potential medical issues.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she\u2019s one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60\u2019s too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually \u2018looking old\u2019 or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can\u2019t see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary\u2019s health. The suspicion isn\u2019t from one particular thing, it\u2019s from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.\n\nAt one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady\u2019s. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson\u2019s, Alzheimer\u2019s, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting \u2018confused and needing naps\u2019, of which she was probably severely punished.\n\nAnd then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn\u2019t mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.\n\n\n\nAnother of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.\n\n\n\nThen there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone\u2019s arm.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don\u2019t see her in person because she looks awful.\n\n\n\nAnd of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she\u2019s gasping for air. It\u2019s incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack \u2014 *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But here\u2019s an especially interesting tidbit:\n\nAs Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority\u2019s logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court\u2019s help, Arizona\u2019s child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver\u2014out of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state\u2019s residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona\u2019s parents and caregivers.\n\nYikes.\n\nBut I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y\u2019all. Because doesn\u2019t government always know best?",

	"text": "After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter\u2019s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton\u2019s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.\n\nThe different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.\n\nAside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary\u2019s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.\n\nSince the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.\n\nThe question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?\n\nWhat we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.\n\nIt is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.\n\nIf anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.\n\nThe American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.\r\n\r\nThe attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.\r\n\r\nThe attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.\r\n\r\nDahir Adan\r\nDahir Adan\r\nSt. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.\r\n\r\nAdan\u2019s terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.\r\n\r\nMembers and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nThe Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an \u201caccomplished student\u201d in high school (but of course).\r\n\r\n\r\nJason Falconer\r\nOfficer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department\r\nSt. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who \u201chappened to be in the right place at the right time.\u201d\r\n\r\nFalconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That\u2019s when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.\r\nOfficer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.\r\n\r\nLast year the Washington Times reported that Obama\u2019s administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.\r\n\r\n\u201cTHIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.\r\n\r\nIn May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.\r\n\r\n\u201cPRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTHEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN \u2013 WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,\u201d HE SAID.\r\n\r\nIn June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.\r\n\r\nIn July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.\r\n\r\nU.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years\r\n\r\nIf Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.\r\n\r\nBreitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It\u2019s clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.\r\n\r\nMen & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.\r\n\r\nHillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.\r\n\r\nA vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.\r\n\r\nSelah.\r\n\r\nFrom Freedom Daily",

Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump\u2019s tax returns as well as other things.\n\nLook at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.\n\n521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton\u2019s win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.\n\nRegardless of these apparent \u201cwinning\u201d results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton\u2019s infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.\n\nWith the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds.

The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public \u201cwarning letter\u201d to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company\u2019s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, \u201cshow much lower potencies in these batches.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company\u2019s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he\u2019s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on \u201caccess\u201d to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. \u201cI have tried to reach out to them,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the \u201cfalse hopes\u201d offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it\u2019s disturbing and very sad,\u201d she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s infamous line, \u201cwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,\u201d the Pope chastised fear-based media.\n\nJournalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of \u201cterrorism\u201d and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of \u201cterrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue\u201d, he said. \u201cThis is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.\u201d Source: Reuters\n\nNow, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy\u2019s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I\u2019m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that\u2019s what has given us Donald Trump.\n\nCrime in the nation is down. An American\u2019s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:\n\nFear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic\n\nSure, that\u2019s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn\u2019t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they\u2019ve succeeded.\n\nFeatured image via Franco Origlia/Getty Images.",

Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we\u2019ve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was \u201cPapa\u201d John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees\u2019 hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn\u2019t.\n\nThis year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn\u2019t get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl\u2019s Jr. and Hardee\u2019s. Here\u2019s one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:\n\nJudging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that\u2019s not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn\u2019t want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:\n\n\u201cI want to try it,\u201d CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. \u201cWe could have a restaurant that\u2019s focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.\u201d \u201cWith government driving up the cost of labor, it\u2019s driving down the number of jobs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.\u201d \u201cThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,\u201d says Puzder. \u201cDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?\u201d Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nThis threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He\u2019s hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.\n\nPuzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.\n\nPuzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don\u2019t see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.\n\nYou can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That\u2019s just the way he is: profits over people.",

According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed \u201cwatered down\u201d drugs to third-world countries.\n\nFrom The Daily Caller:\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed \u201cwatered-down\u201d HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and \u201clikely increased\u201d the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. \u2014 The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. \u2014 The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u2014 The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nThis latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!\n\nDo you think that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world?

During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his \"JV team.\"\n\nSeeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.\n\nThe Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.\n\n\"If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,\" said Obama.\n\nPresident Obama continued by saying that we must \"be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.\"\n\nHe mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as \"a place like Syria, where there\u2019s no ultimate military victory to be won.\"\n\nInstead Obama suggested that we \"pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.\"\n\nWhich may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.\n\nIt's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence.

If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups \u2013 these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low \u2013 would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a \u201cminor setback\u201d to her \u201cinevitable\u201d victory.\n\nThe American people aren\u2019t buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d dismissals. Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cmild cold,\u201d er, \u201cseasonal allergies,\u201d I mean \u201cheat exhaustion,\u201d that is to say \u201cminor case of pneumonia\u201d is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a \u201cmystery man\u201d who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable \u201cepisodes\u201d (or otherwise freezes up with a brain \u201cshort-circuit\u201d during a speech).\n\nThis guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.\n\nBlue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease \u2013 a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has \u201cpneumonia\u201d required a neurological squeeze test?).\n\nThe Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won\u2019t, but they should. I wonder what official \u201cdiagnosis\u201d we\u2019ll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they\u2019ve been there a hundred times before. \u201cNothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton\u2019s sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she \u2018powered through\u2019 yesterday going door-to-door.\u201d\n\nThe point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She\u2019s proven, yet again, that she can\u2019t be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She\u2019s a liar. That\u2019s her default mode. She\u2019s corrupt. And she\u2019s sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else \u2013 including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.\n\nDo I take joy in Mrs. Clinton\u2019s sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. \u201cDo not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice\u201d (Proverbs 24:17).\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters as a \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cirredeemable\u201d \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d has only served to accelerate the plunge.\n\nPerhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement \u2013 especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her \u201cfriend and mentor.\u201d Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags \u2013 the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.\n\nWho\u2019s the racist?\n\nI\u2019m praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can\u2019t help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.\n\nIt\u2019s almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she\u2019s ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she\u2019s put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, \u201cMany are the plans in a person\u2019s heart, but it is the LORD\u2019s purpose that prevails.\u201d\n\nAm I saying there\u2019s no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there\u2019s always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.\n\nStill, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton\u2019s political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector \u2013 a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.\n\nWhen they visit her in prison.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.\n\nDemocrats think the world will agree with them, and they\u2019re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:\n\nA new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.\n\nSo Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says \u201cAmerica first\u201d it\u2019s suddenly racist.\n\nOk, yeah, that sounds logical.\n\nSixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. \u201cFloored\u201d by the results, the pollster laments that the \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d, who he previously thought were just a \u201cmarginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia\u201d, is too big to ignore. He writes: \u201cThis not a \u2018basket of deplorables\u2019 who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. \u201cYes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or \u2018other\u2019 but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.\u201d\n\nDo you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don\u2019t call them \u201cdeplorables,\u201d you recognize that half the country is against you. Let\u2019s get this done in November.\n\n(Source: Breitbart)\n\n\n\n",

	"text": "7k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nLast night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying \u2013 and that the shot came from law enforcement.\n\nOne key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.\u201d\n\nMy friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 \u2014 Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016\n\nWe interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:\n\nI watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. \u2014 BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let\u2019s march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot,\u201d Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.\n\n\u201cThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,\u201d Meyer told me almost breathlessly, \u201cI\u2019ve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant \u2018hands up, don\u2019t shoot\u2019 and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter leaving \u2018The Epicenter,\u2019 police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful \u2013 and that\u2019s when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.\u201d\n\nMeyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, \u201coh, absolutely.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a gunshot,\u201d she told us. \u201cIt was much louder. It wasn\u2019t a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly \u2018They just shot him\u2019 and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn\u2019t already left, exited.\u201d\n\nAt that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.\n\nIt took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was \u2018entirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.\u2019\n\nCNN reports, \u201cPolice say the person was shot by a civilian.\u201d\n\nThe City of Charlotte began spinning the protester\u2019s grave injuries immediately on Twitter:\n\nALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. \u2014 City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016\n\nTwo additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police\u2019s claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.\n\n\u201cI saw the man go down on the pavement,\u201d said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, \u201cIt was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.\u201d\n\n#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV \u2014 Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016\n\nLastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook \u2013 which was also shared via twitter \u2013 that, \u201cwithin 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.\u201d\n\nWhen African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how \u2013 with more violence.\n\nOriginal story by Grant Stern at PINAC News: \u201cWITNESS: Charlotte Riot Police Did Shoot Protester, Deny Involvement Blaming Civilians\u201c\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don\u2019t do, to find out the real story \u2013 and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\n\n\u201cIt was natural for people who\u2019ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn\u2019t do anything they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN\n\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there\u2019s no evidence they got them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the foundation the media doesn\u2019t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn\u2019t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump\u2019s charitable foundation over concerns that it \u201cengaged in some impropriety\u201d as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others\u2019 contributions \u201cto make them appear to have come from him\u201d although he \u201chasn\u2019t given to the foundation since 2008.\u201d Source: Media Matters\n\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton\u2019s candidacy:\n\nJournalists have been criticized for the \u201cdouble standard\u201d in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton\u2019s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post\u2019s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s Dr. Oz stunt.\n\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton \u201cscandal\u201d (if you call getting sick a \u201cscandal\u201d) while ignoring every scandal in Trump\u2019s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.\n\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.",

	"text": "Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.\n\nAnd purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.\n\nAccording to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the \"leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an \u2018Islamic State\u2019 in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nObviously Obama\u2019s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a \u201cJV\u201d team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.\n\nHowever the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.\n\nAnd the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.\n\nHowever what isn\u2019t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.\n\nHere is a link to the Judicial Watch press release detailing the released documents.\n\nHere are the released documents themselves.",

Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary\u2019s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey\u2019s fate.\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. \u201cThis now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director\u2019s fitness for office,\u201d DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills\u2019 computer. \u201cThe contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was not a real investigation. This was a \u2018protected investigation\u2019 designed to look like an investigation.\u201d\n\nDiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened.

He\u2019s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he\u2019s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.\n\nThroughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. \u201cFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia\u201d he tweeted in July. Now \u2013 brace yourself, this might come as a shock \u2013 it appears he\u2019s been lying to us the whole time.\n\nAn ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has \u201cnumerous ties\u201d to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. \u201cThe level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate\u2014[and] be associated with Donald Trump\u201d says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.\n\nTrump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to \u201clarge numbers\u201d of Russian buyers \u2013 so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as \u201cLittle Moscow.\u201d\n\nThe oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.\n\nThe oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense \u2013 they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.\n\n\u201cI think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption\u2026They don\u2019t read books. They don\u2019t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht\u201d says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as \u201ccultural ignoramuses\u2026not interested in social justice.\u201d Sound like anyone we know?\n\nWhen the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow\u2019s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves \u2013 and Trump himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at that, yeah we\u2019ll be looking\u201d said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.\n\nThese business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it\u2019s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.\n\nWatch ABC News\u2019 report here:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

In fact, it is one of his life\u2019s purposes to serve and help his \u2018brothers and sisters\u2019 in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.\n\nOn the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.\n\nFor this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith\u2026he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.\n\nHe has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.\n\n\u201cIn terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,\u201d Wilson concluded. \u201cI think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don\u2019t stress out about much.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to\u2026 themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.\n\nGood men\u2019s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.\n\nEspecially now in Obama\u2019s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there\u2026if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share\u2026 corruption can and will take root.\n\nSo the NFL told him not to talk about his faith\u2026\n\nInteresting how things seem so one sided right? Don\u2019t talk about God, it hurts people\u2019s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it\u2019s heroes.\n\nWith this kind of garbage happening\u2026the truth becomes that much more obvious.\n\nWords like \u2018tolerance\u2019 are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.\n\nAsk yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?\n\nThere is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.\n\n\u2026and Obama\u2019s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",

Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area\u2026 you know, his culture.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: \u2018Muslims don\u2019t belong here\u2019. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.\n\nFrom April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

I\u2019m wondering if anyone else can believe that Ahmad went off the reservation because he felt like he was being targeted for being a Muslim or if it\u2019s more believable that Ahmad is a Muslim who happens to be an extremist and he\u2019s been planning this for some time.",

If the Birther movement is racist\u2026 does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?\n\nWhat if that person is \u2026 Obama?\n\nBreitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled \u201c\u201cKenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate\u201d That was June 2004.\n\nKenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.\n\nIt\u2019s still out there on the internet. Here\u2019s a screen capture:\n\nHere\u2019s the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.\n\nAnd the link to the original.\n\nThat\u2019s not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.\n\nThat was Obama\u2019s publicist.

It also promotes Obama\u2019s anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White\u2013which Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.\n\nIf Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?\n\nIf his birth in America is valid \u2014 as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the \u2018foreigner\u2019 card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of \u2026 whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.\n\nBecause if That WASN\u2019T a lie\u2026 then something else MUST be. That \u2018something else\u2019 being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.\n\nThe quote can be read in context at Breitbart.",

	"text": "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.\n\nFirst proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.\n\nIn other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.\n\nAs Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won\u2019t know the law, and they\u2019ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,\u201d Gitlin said. \u201cThat can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.\u201d\n\nAs we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to watch Pennsylvania,\u201d Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. \u201cGo down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don\u2019t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we\u2019re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion \u2013 I really mean this, Pennsylvania \u2013 is if cheating goes on.\u201d\n\nTrump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to \u201cStop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!\u201d\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.\n\nWith the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump\u2019s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.\n\nFeatured Image: Jeff Swensen/Getty Images",

They care about their lives, don\u2019t kid yourself. When they say they don\u2019t care about their lives, you have to take out their families.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald\u2019s Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism \u2014 he\u2019s fighting the \u201cnarratives\u201d of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump\u2019s \u201cnarrative\u201d is \u201ckill them all\u201d:\n\nLast weekend\u2019s attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama\u2019s watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we\u2019re in more than a fight about \u2018narratives\u2019 \u2013 these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\n\nPay attention to that last bit: \u201cThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.\u201d\n\nNow, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating \u201cterrorists?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re protecting each other, but they\u2019re really doing very bad damage \u2014 they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,\u201d Trump said in March. \u201cWhen they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that\u2019s a big problem.\u201d\n\nIf Muslims are \u201cprotecting\u201d terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump\u2019s eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists\u2019 families. How would he define terrorism?\n\nThese are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself \u2014 but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents\u2019 security to \u201csee what happens\u201d to them (shortly after suggesting that \u201cSecond Amendment People\u201d could deal with them. We\u2019re dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the \u2018little red button\u2019 that launches our nuclear arsenal.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen \u2014 one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.\n\nNormally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He\u2019s said it himself. Many times.\n\nIf we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation \u2014 to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it\u2019s the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.\n\nFeatured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle",

The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don\u2019t. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.\n\nIntegrate or Vacate, but don\u2019t try to change us. You will fail.",

	"text": "5.2k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nJason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it\u2019s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.\n\nThis is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises\u2026 because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton\u2026 EVER.\n\nFrom Bearing Arms:\n\nWe told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn\u2019t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.\n\nFalconer\u2019s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.\n\nThe 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer\u2019s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.\n\nClinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers \u201cimmunity.\u201d It\u2019s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.\n\nJason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",

The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they\u2019re an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization\u2019s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and \u201cother expenses.\u201d The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization\u2019s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as \u201cother expenses,\u201d while the remaining almost $851K was marked as \u201cprofessional fundraising expenses.\u201d Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more \u201cother expenses\u201d in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

No one came at all\u2026 when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.\n\nI watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters.

There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.\n\nFrom Gateway Pundit:\n\nAt Hillary Clinton\u2019s Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee.

They must have been so disappointed.\n\nThe Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.\n\nHillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here\u2026 the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump\u2019s rallies are packed with thousands of people\u2026 he\u2019s making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.\n\nBetween Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary\u2019s health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it\u2019s beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.",

The National Democratic Party, a \u201cpowerful hate group,\u201d has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.\n\n[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America\u2019s Most Powerful HATE Group\n\nAs a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author\u2019s contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get \u201cHillary the Horrible\u201d into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.\n\nA proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone \u2013 especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President \u2013 to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.\n\nThe proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters \u2013 but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens \u2013 to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.\n\nDue to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.\n\nDonald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America\u2019s most powerful \u201cHate Group,\u201d not only wants \u201cHillary the Horrible\u201d to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.\n\nLet us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton\u2019s top aide Huma Abedin.\r\n\r\nApparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained \u201ctens of thousands of e-mails\u201d from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary\u2019s e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.\r\n\r\nOn July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed \u201cdismay,\u201d and \u201cdisgust\u201d with Director Comey\u2019s decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.\r\n\r\nA high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, \u201cIt was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton\u2019s] security clearance yanked.\u201d\r\n\u201cIt is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,\u201d the senior FBI official told Fox News. \u201cWe were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said \u2018but we are doing nothing,\u2019 which made no sense to us.\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aFox News\r\nUPDATE October 17, 2016:\r\nThe FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official \u201cpressured\u201d the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton\u2019s e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.\r\n\r\nThe FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called \u201cThe Shadow Government\u201d who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that \u201cplaced Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for \u2018her election campaign\u2019\u201d.\u200a\u2014\u200aBBC News\r\n\r\nUPDATE October 25, 2016:\r\nAccording to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official\u2019s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nUncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta\r\nIn September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user \u201cstonetear\u201d, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nMr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nWikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016\r\nOn March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:\r\n\r\nFrom:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015\u201303\u201304 20:41 Subject: Special Category\r\nThink we should hold emails to and from potus? That\u2019s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545\r\nIn other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton\u2019s communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.\r\n\r\nUPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up\r\nOn March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton\u2019s private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official\u2019s wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton\u2019s use of a private e-mail server.\r\n\r\nFwd: POTUS on HRC emails\r\nFrom:cheryl.mills@gmail.com To: john.podesta@gmail.com Date: 2015\u201303\u201307 21:41 Subject: Fwd: POTUS on HRC emails\r\nwe need to clean this up\u200a\u2014\u200ahe has emails from her\u200a\u2014\u200athey do not say state.gov\r\n\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014 Forwarded message\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\u200a\u2014\r\nBegin forwarded message: *From:* Josh Schwerin <joshschwerin@gmail.com> *Date:* March 7, 2015 at 6:33:44 PM EST *To:* Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>, Kristina Schake < kristinakschake@gmail.com>, Nick Merrill <nmerrill@hrcoffice.com>, Jesse Ferguson <jfferg@gmail.com> *Subject:* *POTUS on HRC emails*\r\nhttps://twitter.com/katherinemiller/status/574350749280432129/photo/1 Jen you probably have more on this but it looks like POTUS just said he found out HRC was using her personal email when he saw it in the news.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/31077#efmAABABT\r\nUPDATE October 20, 2016: Podesta E-mails Release 13 Confirms President Obama Knew Of Clinton\u2019s Private E-mail Server\r\nOn Mar 8, 2015, at 7:56 AM, Jennifer Palmieri <jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com<mailto:jennifer.m.palmieri@gmail.com>> wrote:\r\nThey know POTUS and HRC emailed. Josh has been asked about that. Standard practice is not to confirm anything about his email, so his answer to press was that he would not comment/confirm. I recollect that Josh was also asked if POTUS ever noticed her personal email account and he said something like POTUS likely had better things to do than focus on his Cabinet\u2019s email addresses.\r\nOn Mar 8, 2015, at 12:40 AM, Philippe Reines <pir@hrcoffice.com<mailto:pir@hrcoffice.com>> wrote:\r\nI find it odd the NYT didn\u2019t actually quote the President saying what\u2019s in their headline. Especially since the story has a disbelieving tone to his not noticing. One of us should connect with the WH just so they know that the email will show his statement to not make sense. I\u2019m happy to do so to Josh Earnest since Jen is in a weird position, unless Cheryl or John you want to (or already have) with someone else. But it\u2019s not unreasonable to assume that Josh is going to get asked how this was possible, and he should have the factset. Especially if it\u2019s some weird technical thing with the President\u2019s email setup that he doesn\u2019t see addresses.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://www.wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/21779\r\nTo make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.\r\n\r\nI know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren\u2019t satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I\u2019ve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc.\u200a\u2014\u200ahttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099\r\nThe reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.\r\n\r\nHowever, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.\r\n\r\nThis suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President\u2019s communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.\r\n\r\nTimeline of Events:\r\nMarch 2, 2015: The New York Times breaks the story that Clinton used a personal e-mail account while Secretary of State.\r\nMarch 4, 2015: The Benghazi committee issues a subpoena requiring preservation of all e-mails.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: Barack Obama states he only learned about the private e-mail server \u201cthrough news reports\u201d at the same time as everybody.\r\nMarch 7, 2015: 15:41:16 -0800 (PST) Cheryl Mills writes EMAIL ID 31077 as revealed by Podesta Emails Part 18: \u201cwe need to clean this up\u200a\u2014\u200ahe has emails from her\u200a\u2014\u200athey do not say state.gov.\u201d\r\nMarch 7, 2015: Hillary Surrogate Terry McCauliffe met with the FBI agent who oversaw the Clinton e-mail case and his wife and promised financial support ($500k+) if she ran for office.\u200a\u2014\u200aWall Street Journal\r\nMarch, 25\u201331, 2015: Paul Cobetta, a Platte River Networks employee, permanently and irreversibly deletes the email archive using a software called BleachBit likely under orders from Cheryl Mills after receiving advice on Reddit on how to delete e-mails for a \u201cVIP\u201d.

	"text": "Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation \u2013 where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners \u2013 the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed \u201cgood\u201d that the foundation has done over the years.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they\u2019re an organization for good.\n\nThe Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:\n\nJust 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization\u2019s IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and \u201cother expenses.\u201d The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization\u2019s IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as \u201cother expenses,\u201d while the remaining almost $851K was marked as \u201cprofessional fundraising expenses.\u201d Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more \u201cother expenses\u201d in 2014.\n\nSometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com",

	"text": "It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he\u2019d made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.\r\n\r\nFirst, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn\u2019t long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals\u2019 butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn\u2019t. He peeked into people\u2019s desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns\u2019 desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music \u2014 the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans \u2014 and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they\u2019d seen. (\u201cHey, bro, it\u2019s the president!\u201d \u201cYeah, bro!\u201d) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word \u201cISIS\u201d came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He\u2019d just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.\r\n\r\nAt first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn\u2019t kidding. \u201cI want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,\u201d he\u2019d tell them. They\u2019d laugh and say something like, \u201cHey, Mr. President, please don\u2019t ever say that again publicly!\u201d Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.\r\n\r\nThey were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other\u2019s eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, \u201cIs it about how you\u2019re really a terrorist?\u201d He looked at her and said, \u201cYes, actually.\u201d She stopped eating her Popsicle. \u201cDonald Trump was right about you?\u201d He nodded. \u201cAbout everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nHe explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He\u2019d made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (\u201cHonestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.\u201d) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.\r\n\r\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that the plot of the first season of Homeland?\u201d Hillary asked. Obama nodded. \u201cKind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.\u201d\r\n\r\nNo one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn\u2019t know what had given it away. He\u2019d been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? \u201cWait, what?\u201d Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo\u2019s eyes were really tiny LED screens. \u201cDid you know that when Bo barks,\u201d Obama said, \u201che\u2019s just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. \u201cYou\u2019re a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?\u201d Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m short-circuiting!\u201d Obama did his best to comfort her. \u201cBo does that sometimes. Then he\u2019ll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman\u2019s floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,\u201d Hillary apologized. \u201cDo you mean a fin?\u201d Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: \u201cBut I haven\u2019t even told you the best part yet. I\u2019m going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIsis?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, ISIS. All caps.\u201d\r\n\r\nHillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn\u2019t want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he\u2019d be. He told her \u201clike for real\u201d they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nHe was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until I\u2019m president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.\u201d Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to \u201cWonderwall\u201d as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair. Pretty soon, it was morning again.",

Trump\u2019s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land.\n\nThe construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply.\n\nThe pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country.\n\nOpposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them.\n\nThe opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump\u2019s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation.\n\nVeterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes.\n\nAnd now we learn that \u201cPresident\u201d Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president.\n\nThis should come as no surprise since Trump \u2018s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president.\n\nThis involvement is another example of Trump\u2019s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation.\n\nAccording to Ethics experts, Trump\u2019s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust.\n\nThe blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it.\n\nThe Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump\u2019s support of the cruel actions of the police.\n\nWe must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.\n\nPlease share this story on Facebook!"

Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. \u201cIf you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is a fact.\u201d\n\nAsked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president\u2019s power, or in other words, its limitations \u2013 if they exist \u2013 Spicer argued that the Constitution \u201cclearly states\u201d what the President of the United States can and cannot do. \u201cHowever,\u201d he added, \u201cone must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn\u2019t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president\u2019s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn\u2019t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.\u201d\n\nSpicer continued, \u201cAs a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there\u2019s a real need to follow the aforementioned \u2018if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president\u2019 rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that\u2019s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Spicer concluded./politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments"

After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster\u2019s death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide.\r\n.\r\nWith new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn\u2019t autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide.\r\n.\r\nLT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital\u2019s forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible.\r\n.\r\nThe doctor who signed Foster\u2019s death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice.\r\n.\r\nThe case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster\u2019s death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau\u2019s resources are made available.\r\n.\r\nIn other words, Clinton will be getting away with murder\u2026again."

The Obama Administration originally said he was taking the properties in order to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, but that was just a clever ruse to fool the sheeple. To make it look legitimate, he also sanctioned two Russian intelligence services and gave 35 government officials 72 hours to leave the United States.\n\nBut that was not what any of this was really about. It never is simple or transparent with the criminal Democrats. Obummer\u2019s power play was just a last ditch effort to grab as much free stuff as possible before the door hit him on his corrupt behind on the way out.\n\nOnce again, we\u2019re really sorry that the poor Obama girls won\u2019t each get a free mansion to trash with their drug, rape and thugs parties.

According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:\n\nPresident Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.\n\nRyan\u2019s office has asserted that he can not be \u201cfired\u201d by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:\n\nSpeaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump\u2019s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.\n\nRelate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn\u2019t say things he doesn\u2019t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:\n\n\u201cMr. Speaker\u2026You\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\nAnd that, as they say, is that."

	"text": "A 32-year old Tampa local has suffered extensive injuries to his lower body after an unconventional attempt to \u2018fill a scuba tank with weed smoke\u2019 failed spectacularly last night. According to the testimony of several witnesses, Darren Winters had consumed a copious quantity of alcohol before making the decision to demonstrate the home-made device.\n\n\u201cDarren\u2019s a recreational diver,\u201d commented one of the injured man\u2019s friends. \u201cFor some time, he\u2019s been tinkering with an old scuba tank that he\u2019d bought cheaply from a dive shop. His plan was to use an air compressor to feed smoke into the tank, and then use a scuba regulator to inhale it.\u201d\n\nMr Winters invited a number of his friends over to his residence, an apartment in Ybor, telling them he\u2019d finally perfected what he called his \u2018scuba bong\u2019. \u201cClearly it wasn\u2019t a bong at all,\u201d pointed out one of his friends when interviewed by local journalists, \u201cbut he was so enamoured with that name we thought best not to correct him.\u201d\n\nWhen his friends assembled at Mr Winter\u2019s residence, they found him heavily intoxicated. \u201cHe\u2019d had a number of celebratory drinks before we arrived, as he was so delighted to finally have his \u2018scuba bong\u2019 up and running.\u201d With his friends present, Mr Winters proceeded to offer a demonstration of the home-made device in action. This is the point that everything went horribly wrong.\n\nAccording to the witnesses, Mr Winters was attempting to reattach the air compressor when he stumbled, knocking the scuba tank off a workbench and onto the concrete floor. \u201cThe tank basically exploded after [Winters] knocked it over,\u201d commented one of the witnesses. None of Winter\u2019s friends were injured, but the blast from the ruptured tank sent shrapnel flying directly into his lower body.\n\nWinter\u2019s friends quickly phoned for an ambulance and he was rushed to hospital, where surgeons spent over eight hours treating his extensive wounds. His condition has now been downgraded from \u2018critical\u2019 to \u2018serious\u2019, but medical staff announced they\u2019d been unable to save his testicles which had been \u2018cleanly severed\u2019 by a shard of metal.\n\nPreliminary investigations have identified that the scuba tank used by Winters may be banned from dive use throughout the US. \u201cThis tank was manufactured prior to 1992 and made of a type aluminium alloy that is known to have a high risk of fracturing,\u201d commented the lead investigator on the case. \u201cWe regularly audit dive shops in Tampa to ensure these tanks are not being sold; however, the ban only extends to using the tank when diving. If [Winters] purchased the tank for the purpose of inhaling cannabis, the retailer has technically not breached the law.\u201d\n\nThis news will be little comfort to Mr Winters, who will likely be unable to file for compensation against the business that sold him the defective tank. The young man faces a long recovery, but his associates shared their optimism that he would pull through. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the toughest guys I know,\u201d commented one of Mr Winter\u2019s friends. \u201cHe\u2019ll take the fact he won\u2019t be able to have kids pretty hard, though.\u201d\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post stated the victim was unemployed. Mr Winters is actually employed on a part-time basis at a Tampa pizza restaurant. We regret the error.\n\nIn other news making headlines, a 68-year old man from Decatur in Northern Alabama has discovered that his new bride is actually his own grand-daughter. The couple have no plans to divorce."

Minnesota has just established a similar law.\n\nAnti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.\n\nAccording to Minneapolis\u2019 local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to \u201charass them.\u201d The Star Tribune reported:\n\nThe city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.\n\nThe service, operated through the city\u2019s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any \u201charassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,\u201d according to a city news release issued on Monday.\n\nThe announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.\n\n\u201cSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website.\n\nThe Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: \u201cI will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump\u2019s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.\u201d The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal\u2019s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don\u2019t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don\u2019t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim\u2019s demands. This \u201canti-blasphemy\u201d hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germany\u2019s approach in the 1930\u2019s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think? Share this with your friends and family.\n\nH/T Freedom Daily"

Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower. Any student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section.\n\nHe did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student\u2019s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that."

If you doubt that Donald Trump is God\u2019s chosen leader, however, you may be inviting misfortune upon yourself and succeeding generations of your family according to some Evangelical leaders. Mary Colbert for one, is certain of this:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that Donald Trump is all that perfect of a guy. We all know he\u2019s not. And we know that he\u2019s not necessarily perfect in every way that we would like. That\u2019s not how God works. He works through the ones he chooses. We don\u2019t choose them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll we have to do is recognize them and when you recognize a chosen one and you have the discernment to know that they\u2019ve been chosen and know that that\u2019s the will of God, then your life will be blessed. And if you come against the chosen one of God, you are bringing upon you and your children and your children\u2019s children curses like you have never seen. It puts a holy fear in me.\n\nEvangelist Kenneth Copeland echoes Mary Colbert\u2019s warning, and fleshes out how God will mete out punishment for not supporting President Trump, when he appeared on the Trinity Broadcasting Network last year:\n\n\u201cIf Christians don\u2019t support Trump, they are risking the wrath of God. Trump has been chosen by God, and by rejecting him, they are rejecting God. They could be punished with barrenness, poverty, or even having a gay child.\u201d\n\nCopeland appeared on Colbert\u2019s \u201cPray for America\u201d call-in prayer this morning, and from the looks of what we see here, it was a meeting of like minds.\n\n\n\n"

	"text": "House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) this week disputed reports that 22 million people would lose insurance under the Republican health care plan. During an interview that aired on Tuesday, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade asked Ryan to respond to a recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report that said there would be 22 million more people without health insurance by 2026 if the Senate\u2019s version of the health care bill is signed into law. \u201cWhat they are basically saying at the Congressional Budget Office, if you\u2019re not going to force people to buy Obamacare, if you\u2019re not going to force people to buy something they don\u2019t want, then they won\u2019t buy it,\u201d the Speaker opined. \u201cSo, it\u2019s not that people are getting pushed off a plan, it\u2019s that people will choose not to buy something that they don\u2019t like or want.\u201d\n\nKilmeade then asked Ryan to comment on the fact that the Republican health care platform is going to make health insurance plans significantly less affordable by decreasing subsidies for poorer Americans. Ryan replied by ranting about how being poor is \u201ca choice.\u201d \u201cThis is something we\u2019ve been over on more than once occasion,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI know why you\u2019re asking me this; you want me to feel guilty for depriving 22 million people of health insurance, right? Well, I\u2019m sorry Brian, but it\u2019s not working. And the reason why it\u2019s not working is, you\u2019re using the wrong logic here. You\u2019re using the wrong logic alongside millions of other Americans, because all of you feel that those who get up every day and work hard for some reason owe something to those who just lie around doing nothing. That\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should anybody who has the willpower to tackle problems and obstacles in order to provide a good life for themselves and their family be obligated to set aside some of their hard earned money to help other people who don\u2019t want to work hard and, instead, rely on policymakers to ensure they have welfare or, in this case, affordable health insurance?\u201d Ryan opined. \u201cThe answer is \u2013 they shouldn\u2019t. This is a land of opportunities; but, the thing is, to be able to capitalize on those opportunities, one has to be willing to work hard. And that\u2019s the only condition, working hard. If you work your butt off every single day, you can afford whatever you want, including the best health insurance possible. Now we arrive at my ultimate point: if you choose to work hard, if that\u2019s a choice you make every time you wake up in the morning, then this is something that guarantees your success. But, if you choose to be lazy all day and expect the government to take care of you, then you\u2019re doomed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing rich or poor is a matter of choice; that\u2019s all there is to it. So, let me ask you this, Brian: if 22 million people consciously make the choice to not work hard day in and day out, why on earth should the rest of us be concerned with whether or not they\u2019re going to be healthy? If they choose to be poor, then it\u2019s their own problem if they can\u2019t afford to be healthy. Think of the message we\u2019d be sending to poor people around the world by nurturing laziness and providing affordable healthcare to poor people. We\u2019d be sending them an open invitation to come here and do nothing. \u2018Just come on over and become a U.S. citizen \u2013 the government will get you free food, free shelter and free health insurance, and you don\u2019t even have to get a job.\u2019 That\u2019s preposterous, anyone who thinks that\u2019s a good thing deserves to be poor,\u201d he concluded."

Three years after Fox\u2019s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.\n\nAmong many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company\u2019s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and \u201crunning Mall of America into the ground,\u201d on the basis of Santa \u201calways having been white in the Bible.\u201d \u201cNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,\u201d Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.\n\nShe also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was \u201cthe last straw\u201d in corporate America\u2019s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, \u201cbecause they realized they couldn\u2019t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they\u2019ve been using so far.\u201d She added, \u201cThat\u2019s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won\u2019t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don\u2019t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,\u201d Palin added. \u201cThe Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don\u2019t, if we let them get away with it, what\u2019s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we\u2019re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that\u2019s happening by accident?\u201d\n\n\u201cNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,\u201d she concluded."

	"text": "BREAKING!\n\nLiberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA \u201cconfirming\u201d Russian interference in the presidential election.\n\nThey\u2019re saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!\n\nScary!\n\nFrom HuffPo:\n\nA 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.\n\nIn light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump\u2019s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.\n\nAt 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.\n\nThe development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become \u201cfaithless\u201d or \u201cconscientious\u201d electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.\n\nThe electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton\u2019s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation\u2019s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.\n\nProponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives."

In the video, the rapper shoots a clown version of President Trump with a toy gun, but that\u2019s not what got him in trouble.\n\nAfter the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said:\n\n\u201cNo, man. I don\u2019t like violence any more than the next guy, but I would hope that if this clown in the White House was about to start a war or somethin\u2019 that someone would do what I did but with a real gun. I know I would and I would encourage anyone who could get close enough to do the same. That\u2019s not violence\u2026it\u2019s survival of the species.\u201d\n\nThe reporter, Glen Dingusman, immediately contacted the Secret Service with his evidence of violent threats made against the president and Snoop Dogg, who was on his way into a restaurant for lunch when the exchange happened, never made it past his hot wing appetizer.\n\nAccording to the agency, he will be held as a military combatant without being charged until they can ascertain whether or not he\u2019s a threat to the president. At the very least, this should teach him and some other dumb liberals a good lesson about what happens in Trump\u2019s America if you say and do stupid crap."

It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.\n\nBut this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.\n\nA Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she\u2019s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.\n\nWhen she came back from work, she came into her baby\u2019s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.\n\nShe rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.\n\nShe was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn\u2019t breathing.\n\nShe carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.\n\nThe medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.\n\nShe never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.\n\nThe thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.\n\nThe label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.\n\nSadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.\n\nWe must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness."

	"text": "\n\nAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.\n\nThe allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds \u2013 literally.\n\nThis shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name \u201cAlexi Jonesinov\u201d) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.\n\nHowever, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.\n\nIt was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.\n\nIt may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.\n\n\u201cWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,\u201d one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people\u2019s actions as \u201cRussian neuro-brain hacking.\u201d\n\nThis method was developed by the KGB, which became the FSB following the fall of the USSR.\n\nWhat we know for a fact is that the only reason anyone would vote for Donald Trump is that they were being influenced, whether through cash payments, blackmail or space beams, by Russian agents from the FSB (formerly the KGB).\n\n\u201cIf people were not beholden to Russia, they would have voted for Hillary Clinton,\u201d a senior agent said, citing a definitive analysis by CrowdStrike, a contractor hired by the DNC to investigate Russian space-beam mind control.\n\nWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were \u201cridiculous,\u201d \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cgoofy.\u201d\n\nSenator Chuck Schumer called the response from Peskov \u201cpredictable,\u201d adding, \u201cwhat do you expect from the criminal Putinist regime that kills journalists, oppresses gays, invaded the Ukraine, murdered innocent Syrians and hacked our elections by controlling people\u2019s brains with a space-beam?\u201d\n\nUpon hearing of the revelation of the fact that 62 million American voters are working directly for Russia, Senator John McCain has called for mass arrests. He referred to all Trump voters as \u201cradical traitors to the core values and principles of democracy and human rights,\u201d and demanded they be imprisoned and their homes given over to Syrian refugees.\n\nTOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"

This comes just hours after a man was dragged off of an overbooked United Airlines flight when he refused to get off the plane. He was pulled out of his seat and thrown into the aisle as seen on a video released on Monday.\n\nThe baby, whose name has not been released, was left with a welt mark across his face due to the assault. Eyewitnesses say the little boy was screaming for about 38 minutes straight and the parents were asked by the flight attendant several times to \u201cquiet that annoying ass baby down.\u201d\n\nAfter the 4th attempt to get the parents to comply, the flight attendant erupted into a rage grabbing the baby from the mother\u2019s arms and slapping him in the face. It took several passengers to subdue the United Airlines employee.\n\nThe flight attendant was restrained in the back of the plane until the Pilot could make an emergency landing in Missouri. United Airlines released a statement saying the employee acted in a way that does not represent their company and has been fired.\n\nThe little boy is said to be in stable condition with no life-threatening injuries.

	"text": "Seth Rich Seth Rich\n\n- EDITOR'S NOTE (5/17/17): We want to update you on a story you first saw on FOX 5 DC. We want to make an important clarification on claims that were made by Rod Wheeler, the private investigator hired by Seth Rich's family, whose services are being paid for by a third party.\n\nWhat he told FOX 5 DC on camera Monday regarding Seth Rich's murder investigation is in clear contrast to what he has said over the last 48 hours. Rod Wheeler has since backtracked.\n\nIn an interview Monday, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC he had sources at the FBI confirming there was evidence of communication between Seth Rich and WikiLeaks. This is the verbatim of that exchange:\n\nFOX 5 DC: \u201cYou have sources at the FBI saying that there is information...\u201d\n\nWHEELER: \"For sure...\"\n\nFOX 5 DC: \u201c...that could link Seth Rich to WikiLeaks?\"\n\nWHEELER: \"Absolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"\n\nIn the past 48 hours, Rod Wheeler has told other media outlets he did not get his information from FBI sources, contradicting what he told us on Monday.\n\nSince Rod Wheeler backtracked Tuesday, FOX 5 DC attempted incessantly to communicate with him, but he didn't return calls or emails.\n\nOn Wednesday, just before our newscast, Wheeler responded to our requests via a telephone conversation, where he now backtracks his position and Wheeler characterizes his on-the-record and on-camera statements as \"miscommunication.\"\n\nWhen asked if Wheeler is still working for Seth Rich's family, Wheeler told FOX 5 DC the contract still stands-- ties have not been severed.\n\nWe reached out once again to the Rich family, and through a spokesperson the Rich family tells FOX 5 DC, \"The family has relayed their deep disappointment with Rod Wheeler's conduct over the last 48 hours, and is exploring legal avenues to the family.\"\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal story:\n\nIt has been almost a year since Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered in the nation's capital. There have been no solid answers about why he was killed until now.\n\nRich was shot and killed last July in Northwest D.C and police have suggested the killing in the District's Bloomingdale neighborhood was a botched robbery. However, online conspiracy theories have tied the murder to Rich's work at the DNC.\n\nJust two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich's death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.\n\nRod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich's laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death. Wheeler's services were offered to the family and paid for by a third party, according to a statement issued by the Rich family Tuesday which also includes that \"the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"\n\nNow, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.\n\nWheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich\u2019s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation.\n\n\"The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cThey haven't been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both.\u201d\n\nWhen we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said, \u201cAbsolutely. Yeah. That's confirmed.\"\n\nWheeler also told us, \"I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said, \u2018Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can\u2019t share any information with you.\u2019 Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don\u2019t think it comes from the chief\u2019s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor's office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].\n\nWheeler told FOX 5 that he will provide us with a full report with the new details.\n\nFOX 5's Melanie Alnwick spoke with D.C. Police on Tuesday and was told that Wheeler\u2019s assertion that a source inside the department told him that detectives were instructed to stand down regarding the Rich case was false.\n\nThe family sent Alnwick a statement on Tuesday with the following statement:\n\n\"As we've seen through the past year of unsubstantiated claims, we see no facts, we have seen no evidence, we have been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the press. Even if tomorrow, an email was found, it is not a high enough bar of evidence to prove any interactions as emails can be altered and we've seen that those interested in pushing conspiracies will stop at nothing to do so. We are a family who is committed to facts, not fake evidence that surfaces every few months to fill the void and distract law enforcement and the general public from finding Seth's murderers. The services of the private investigator who spoke to press was offered to the Rich family and paid for by a third party, and contractually was barred from speaking to press or anyone outside of law enforcement or the family unless explicitly authorized by the family.\"\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE ON THE SETH RICH MURDER INVESTIGATION:\n\nFamily of DNC staffer Seth Rich seeking to raise money to help solve his murder\n\nRepublican lobbyist says murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich linked to Russian operatives\n\nMother of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich pleads for public's help\n\nRepublican lobbyist offers $100K reward in murder of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich\n\nWikiLeaks offers $20K reward in murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich\n\nWikiLeaks founder addresses death of DNC staffer Seth Rich in Fox News interview\n\nComments by Julian Assange fuel speculation that murdered DNC staffer may have been WikiLeaks source\n\nWhat happened during final hours slain DNC employee Seth Rich was alive?\n\nParents of slain DNC employee make emotional plea to help find son's killer\n\nDNC honors murdered staffer Seth Rich with memorial bike rack outside of headquarters\n\nVigil held for slain DNC staffer in Bloomingdale\n\nDNC employee fatally shot in Northwest DC"

	"text": "President Donald Trump was very active on Twitter Easter morning and lashed back at protesters wanting to see his tax returns, saying he shouldn\u2019t have to show them since he \u201ceasily won the Electoral College.\u201d Moments after he defended no longer calling China a currency manipulator, now that they are giving him a helping hand with North Korea, Trump dismissed calls for his tax returns by responding on Twitter. \u201cI did what was almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?\u201d Trump tweeted.\r\n\r\nAs always, his son Eric was there to provide a helping hand in defending his father. During an brief phone interview with KYXL Radio based out of Orlando, Florida, President Trump\u2019s second son argued that his father\u2019s tax return is \u201cirrelevant,\u201d largely because \u201che knows all there is to know about following the letter of the law, especially when it comes to paying taxes.\u201d He said, \u201cWhen you come from a background like the one my father comes from, you have to know all there is about paying taxes and doing your part to make this country a better place.\u201d\r\n\r\nEric continued, \u201cAnd while we\u2019re on the subject, I kind of have to say, it\u2019s funny how taxes work. They sort of punish the hardest working and most productive members of our society while taking nothing from those who would rather be lazy and beg on the streets. That\u2019s kind of not fair. What he have here is a system that flat out punishes those who want to contribute and make their lives better and at the same time, rewards those who want to be nothing more than dead weight. The worst part is, I\u2019m not saying something that\u2019s revolutionary here; this system has been in place ever since the country was established. My father, regardless of the fact that he\u2019s president, is just one person out of millions of those who are capable enough to be successful but are simultaneously struck down by our tax system. That\u2019s a catastrophe.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe self-proclaimed businessman then revealed plans to \u201cfix\u201d the broken tax system of the United States. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s irrelevant whether my father choses to disclose his tax return or not. It won\u2019t matter soon anyway,\u201d Eric argued. Asked to elaborate, he said that President Trump is soon going to move forward with an executive order that \u201ccancels taxes for extra productive people in the U.S. economy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s our way of saying \u2018good job\u2019 to all those hard-working men and women who are single-handedly keeping our national budget afloat by working around the clock and paying their taxes. It is to them that this country owes its gratitude. They are the reason we are the single greatest nation in the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAs for the fact that my father happens to be among the people who are to be freed from paying tax, I can assure you there is no conflict of interest there. This is not a move designed to make it so my father doesn\u2019t have to pay tax; like I said, it\u2019s a sort of \u2018thank you\u2019 from him to the entrepreneurs, businessmen and other hard-working Americans who have done their duties thus far. As for the rest, I guess they\u2019ll just have to find some other way to get free meals once the economy starts favoring those who are willing to actually get off their butts and go to work. No more freeloaders, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going with this. Bottom line, if you\u2019ve got two working legs and a minimally functioning brain, you can sustain yourself. And you\u2019re going to have to pretty soon,\u201d Eric concluded."

This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn\u2019t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they\u2019re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if \u201cwestern culture\u201d offends them so!\n\nAccording to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a \u201cdisputed view\u201d of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, \u201cRequiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of \u2018forced assimilation\u2019 of the Muslim community.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the pledge:\n\nFrom this time forward, [under God,]\n\nI pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,\n\nwhose democratic beliefs I share,\n\nwhose rights and liberties I respect, and\n\nwhose laws I will uphold and obey.\n\nPretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can\u2019t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here\u2019s the national anthem:\n\nAustralians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We\u2019ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature\u2019s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history\u2019s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We\u2019ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who\u2019ve come across the seas We\u2019ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.\n\nSuper oppressive lyrics, right?\n\nIf a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.\n\nMoreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.\n\nIf those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter\u2026it\u2019s really that simple.\n\nWatch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.\n\nThis is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation\u2019s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!\n\nEither assimilate, or LEAVE.\n\nThey are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It\u2019s their faith. The west doesn\u2019t get it because most liberals are faithless.\n\nIt irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don\u2019t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian\u2019s convert or be beheaded!\n\nIt makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn\u2019t pray\u2026 but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won\u2019t want to learn the country they have invaded history\u2026 because its not theirs!\n\nMuslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.\n\nThis what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.\n\nDo you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?"

	"text": "Need more proof that liberalism is a disease? Two United States Representatives were just arrested for plotting to carry out the assassination of President Trump. These aren\u2019t some off-the-hook left wing extremists, they\u2019re typical men with what seem like typical lives but liberalism has turned them insane with jealousy and rage.\n\nRep. Harold Spunkmeyer (D-Illinois) and Rep. Johnathon Leominster Jr (D-Massachusetts) were taken to a military holding facility under suspicion of terrorism for plotting to murder the President. Several of their closest aides as well as their families have also been detained. As we speak, a special unit of the Secret Service is closing the net on all of their friends and anyone else who could potentially cause harm to President Trump.\n\nAccording to reports, intelligence was gathered from the men\u2019s computers that they were planning to ambush the president during one of his trips to Florida, giving them 4 to 5 possible attack attempts per month to work with. It\u2019s unclear where exactly the attacks would have taken place, but the agents in charge of the investigation say they are certain the men were serious about the plan:\n\n\u201cTheir plans were hidden from plain sight in what they said was a \u2018design for a new video game,\u2019\u201d said Special Agent George Ketterman, \u201cWhile they never actually used the president\u2019s name or purchased any of the items listed in the \u2018game,\u2019 like grappling hooks, stinger missiles, bulletproof jetskis or yellow cake uranium, there was enough evidence when presented to the president for him to order us to take them as terrorism suspects.\u201d\n\nIn unrelated news, the men were known to be strong opponents of the Trump agenda and were also organizing massive protests and marches in their districts. ABC reports that between them they had raised more signatures opposing Trump\u2019s executive orders on immigration and travel than any other lawmakers in Washington.\n\nNBC News tried to reach out to the men\u2019s lawyers to see if there would be a statement available but couldn\u2019t find one. It would appear that the men, their families and whoever may have been stupid enough to represent them will just disappear as enemies of the state under the Patriot Act.\n\nWelcome to Trump\u2019s America, liberals. If you step out of line you\u2019ll be removed altogether."

And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.\u201d\n\nBefore the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators \u2014 both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included \u201cWhere\u2019s Mitch?\u201d while opponents chanted, \u201cHey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.\u201d\n\nAs Fox news reported earlier, the mayor\u2019s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders."

And being a liberal elite, he can get away with it. Everywhere President Donald Trump goes, Obama shows up too. A little odd, no? This concerning practice has gotten on the last nerve of the Trump administration and it shows that they are concerned with what Obama is trying to do. Obama needs to realize that he is no longer the president, no matter how much he wants to be.\n\nObama first went to Italy when Trump was there to try to disrupt what was going on there. Does he not know when to give up? It seems like now is as good a time as any. Obama\u2019s administration is currently under investigation for many criminal actions they did while in office. Maybe he wants to try to deflect all of the negative press about him to Trump, like he so often does. But this last on was truly an Obama move.\n\nThe liberal media has been attacking the Trump administration for the hotel accommodations snafu that caused them to be without a hotel for awhile. But as it turns out, that was actually the Obama administration\u2019s problem, not Trumps. So he is getting blamed for something that is clearly not his fault yet again. That is what conservatives have gotten used to over the years. Apparently liberals can do no wrong. When will the mainstream media report on that?\n\n\u201cThe funny thing,\u201d a White House official said, \u201cis that the United States delegation probably also would not have had hotel rooms if Hillary Clinton had become president. It was already too late by Election Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I bet even if Hillary had to sleep in a youth hostel,\u201d he went on, \u201cno one in the press would say it was her staffs\u2019 fault.\u201d\n\nThat is the double standard that we have to live with as Americans and it will not get any better.

Barack Obama will be on the new dollar bill.\r\n\r\nThe Obama Administration feels that the American dollar is in bad need of a makeover.  They have partnered with the Dollar ReDe$ign Project to pick a new design for U.S. currency.  Currently, the design that the administration likes best was done by Dowling Duncan (a British duo), which features a unique vertical design.  It also features President Obama on the one dollar bill.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe love the Dowling Duncan look.

He is still soliciting ideas for the dollar bill of the future. \u201cOur great \u2018rival\u2019, the Euro, looks so spanky in comparison it seems the only clear way to revive this global recession is to rebrand and redesign,\u201d the project notes on its website.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the web site for  The Dollar Redesign Project.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t waste your time submitting a design, it\u2019s a done deal,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff.

Thomas Jefferson, who was on the nickel, will be\u2026 discontinued.\u201d  Republican  Congressman Paul Ryan suggested President Obama be  put on both the \u201cnickel and dime\u201d instead of the penny.\r\n\r\nAnother American icon might also be replaced.  \u201cUncle Sam is outdated,\u201d said Axelrod.  \u201cWe need to update this icon as well.

	"text": "The biggest story this week was the arrest of Pakistani Muslim and longtime aide of Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Imran Awan. Earlier this year, Awan and his two other brothers were caught trying to leave the country with stolen laptops that contained top secret information from various congressmen. Shortly, after the brothers were arrested a criminal investigation commenced and Imran realized that he was going to go to jail for a very long time. In his attempt to avoid facing justice, Awan tried to flee the country but was picked up by police at the Dulles International Airport. This, of course, is scandalous, to say the least, and it was turned up another few notches after Imran hired his lawyer. The lawyer that was hired to defend Imran was no other but a close Clinton family associate and lawyer Chris Gowen.\n\nHere is more from Conservative Review:\n\nIn 2012, Gowen went to bat for Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, whose family is deeply connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. After GOP reps explored Abedin\u2019s nefarious ties, Gowen pledged to \u201cstand with Huma.\u201d\n\nAlong with his private practice, the longtime Clinton aide is also an adjunct professor at American University Washington College of Law, where he teaches courses on legal ethics and law practice management.\n\nGowen\u2019s Clinton connections are intriguing on another level, given that Awan\u2019s employer in the House, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, remains a close Clinton confidant. The former Democratic National Committee chair resigned from her position after emails surfaced alleging she attempted to tip the scales of the Democratic primary in Clinton\u2019s favor. Wasserman Schultz was also the 2008 campaign co-chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s first failed run for president.\n\nReading this you would think that the mainstream media would be reporting this story non-stop, but that has not occurred at all. In fact, ABC, NBC, and CBS have dedicated a whopping 37 seconds to this political scandal. Of course, that seems ludicrous, but it is obvious that the mainstream media does not want to get to the bottom of this at all. However, that has not stopped Americans from pressing for more information, and the heat is getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nNow, they are reports that Debbie is not fairing well, and has been an absolute wreck since Imran\u2019s arrest. Also, there are calls for Debbie to testify before Congress growing louder, and it seems that she is about to cave.\n\nHere is more from Conservative Fighters:\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz employed Pakistani IT staffers and brothers who were paid over $4 million dollars over the course of their employment even though they were accused of a cyber-security breach.\n\nImran Awan was arrested as he attempted to flee the U.S. after wiring approximately $300,000 to Pakistan. Fox News is the only cable network covering this huge scandal. When Imran Awan was arrested he was carrying $12,000 in cash on him. His wife was carrying $12,000 of cash when she fled the country too.\n\nImran and his Muslim brothers, Abid and Jamal accessed unauthorized computers while acting as IT specialists. The three brothers were making $161,000, $165,000, and $160,000 and one of the brothers has a criminal background.\n\nWord has it that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is an absolute wreck since Imran Awan was arrested. Calls for her to testify to Congress are increasingly growing as well.\n\nWasserman Schultz knows she\u2019s in hot water over this IT scandal. The Gateway Pundit previously reported the FBI seized smashed hard drives belonging to Imran Awan. We also reported that Debbie Wasserman Schultz threatened the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police with \u2018consequences\u2019 for holding equipment that she says belonged to her in order to build a criminal case against a Pakistani IT staffer suspected of massive cyber security breaches.\n\nIt is rather clear in watching the video that Debbie Wasserman Schultz has something to hide. Since, why would she threaten the police if there was nothing in the equipment that could point back to her or the Clinton\u2019s?\n\nJohn Cardillo reports, \u2018Florida politicos who have known Wasserman Schultz for years are telling me she\u2019s a nervous wreck, barely able to function since Imran Awan\u2019s arrest.\n\nFL politicos who have known @DWStweets for years are telling me she's a nervous wreck, barely able to function, since #ImranAwan's arrest. \u2014 John Cardillo (@johncardillo) July 27, 2017\n\nThen someone witnessed Wasserman Schultz in the midst of an epic meltdown in public. Is it possible that Wasserman Schultz is realzing that the DNC is crumbling all around her now?\n\nMELTDOWN: From trusted source\u2013 @DWStweets seen screaming at teen daughter today in public over a 2$ purse pic.twitter.com/i7Y0RI9c8S \u2014 Jim Hoft (@gatewaypundit) July 28, 2017\n\nEstablishment Media Refuse To Cover House IT Scandal Rocking Democrats https://t.co/LNwZHmknTf pic.twitter.com/QoknOsz3C8 \u2014 The Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) July 27, 2017\n\nThis is why alternative news is exploding over the traditional sources of media. The mainstream media is refusing to cover this story but will report the fake Russian collusion story, and President Trump\u2019s ban on transgenders in the military. They will do anything they can to stop the real truth of what is happening in our government to be revealed.\n\nDebbie Wasserman Schultz holds the key to many answers that the American people deserve to know. Hopefully, by keeping the pressure on Wasserman Schultz she will crack and we can get to the bottom of the DNC corruption once and for all.\n\nSHARE IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH EXPOSED!"

	"text": "On Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has \u201csanctioned\u201d violence, as long it protects the \u201cpeople favorable to the Obama position, politically.\u201d She insisted that the president is sending \u201ca signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don\u2019t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.\u201d She also linked the Obama administration\u2019s \u201clawlessness\u201d to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving \u201cnormal\u201d people helpless in the face of anarchy.\n\n\u201cAnd these days it has become so obvious that I\u2019m honestly surprised we\u2019re not having riots throughout the country,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen did this become a nation of criminals? I didn\u2019t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I\u2019m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.\u201d\n\nThe ex-Rep. then argued that \u201cnot even slaves\u201d suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. \u201cIt\u2019s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I\u2019m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear \u2013 we\u2019re supposed to be all evolved right now, we\u2019re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He\u2019s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you\u2019ve seen in Minneapolis.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact,\u201d Bachmann continued firing, \u201cI don\u2019t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what\u2019s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama\u2019s presidency.\u201d She added, \u201cBecause, let\u2019s face it, during that time, we\u2019ve had the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we\u2019ve had countless terrorist attacks, we\u2019ve had many racial killings and crimes and we\u2019ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America\u2019s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I\u2019m guessing he does.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s get one thing straight \u2013 I\u2019m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I\u2019d be saying the same thing all over again,\u201d Bachmann quipped. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to point out \u2013 white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I\u2019m seriously worried whether or not we\u2019ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we\u2019re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we\u2019ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another \u2013 white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that\u2019s just one step away from extinction,\u201d Bachmann concluded./politicot.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments"

	"text": "The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can\u2019t get legally at all.\n\nAsked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that \u201cabortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.\u201d \u201cSo, let\u2019s get that straight right away \u2013 I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn\u2019t developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we\u2019re murderers of innocent beings who can\u2019t defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?\u201d the Indiana governor said.\n\n\u201cAnd as if that wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Pence continued, \u201cwe\u2019ve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that\u2019s bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost \u2013 we can\u2019t have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let\u2019s be clear. And that\u2019s part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I\u2019m going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nPence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. \u201cFirst and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We\u2019d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s new running mate also said, \u201cBasically, if I\u2019d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they\u2019d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it\u2019s not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher\u2019s knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I\u2019m not a murderer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd it gets worse \u2013 when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana\u2019s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I\u2019m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,\u201d Pence concluded."

	"text": "Police in Vernal Heights, Florida, arrested 3-practicing cannibals who claim eating human flesh cures both type-1 and type-2 diabetes and depression.\n\nAccording to Vernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, the 3-men were arrested when officers responded to what they assumed would be a routine noise complaint.\n\nPolice arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane (the home of William Provost) at approximately 7:45 PM on Sunday evening in response to a neighbor complaining of strange sounds coming from the home.\n\nResponding officers told reporters that they assumed their visit to the house would be a quick one and that they would simply be asking the residents to keep the noise down.\n\nWhen the officers arrived at 3845 Toolson Lane, they repeatedly knocked on the door and rang the doorbell, however, nothing could be heard over the sound a stereo inside the house repeatedly playing the same song, which was later identified as \u2013 Enya\u2019s \u2018Who Can Say\u2019.\n\nAfter attempting to get the attention of the homeowner via knocking and ringing the doorbell for approximately 5-minutes, police entered the home through an unlocked door located at the rear of the house.\n\nThe responding officers told reporters that the house had been extremely dark, cluttered, and an overwhelming smell (which was later identified as decomposing flesh) filled the home. Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home\u2019s basement.\n\nAccording to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement\u2019s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.\n\nWilliam Provost, who police believe to be the group\u2019s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:\n\n\u201cI find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don\u2019t, so I stick to what works for me\u201d.\n\nUpon searching the home\u2019s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.\n\nPolice also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.\n\nIn addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift \u2018tool wall\u2019 that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.\n\nUpon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.\n\nVernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.\n\n\u201cThough modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nProvost\u2019s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer\u2019s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.\n\nAll three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail."

ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed.\n\nWhether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian\u2013they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States.\n\nA Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils.\n\nState Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver\u2019s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving.\n\nSpencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer\u2019s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk.\n\n\u201cThis bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,\u201d Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta.\n\nMany people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose.\n\nHere is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible?\n\nQuran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.\n\nI will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.\n\nFight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority.\n\nIs that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities?\n\nJust for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone\u2013so how is this any different?\n\nThere is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe.\n\nWhile Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation.\n\nThe threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans."

	"text": "New York Man Wanted For Infecting 240 Men And Women With HIV!!!\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will blow your mind\u2026Read how a New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women.\n\n\u201cI met Stephawn when I was 19 years old,\u201d explains Joshua Johnson on his blog.\n\nHe continues:\n\n\u201cAt 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.\n\nJohnson goes on to explain in great detail how he fell victim to a sexually promiscuous fugitive who is wanted for allegedly infecting at least 240 people with the HIV virus that causes AIDS.\n\nLadies, as you read Joshua\u2019s story below, keep in mind that black women are the fastest growing HIV demographic in the U.S. due to bisexual men who in relationships with women because they are confused about their sexuality.\n\nGay and bisexual men, regardless of race, are more sexually promiscuous than their heterosexual counterparts, according to Seekingarrangement.com and other reports.\n\nAuthorities in New York City are offering up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of 31-year-old Isaac Don Burks, aka Stephawn Burks, Stefan Levine, Isaac Levine, Stefan Burks, and Walter Brooks.\n\nBurks is described as an African-American male, medium brown skin, six feet two inches tall, weighing 185 pounds. The NYPD is looking for a fugitive they say has embarked on a terrifying campaign to \u201cinfect as many people as possible\u201d with the HIV virus, and they caution that his victims could run into the hundreds.\n\nIsaac Don Burks, 31, has been indicted on eight counts of criminal transmission of HIV, prosecutors announced Friday, and warned that Burks targets people via popular gay websites and networking apps, such as Adam4Adam, Grindr, Jackd, and BGCLive.\n\nBurks, a black gay man from West New York, NJ, just outside Manhattan, who police say may have started his \u201cmission to infect as many people as possible\u201d with HIV as far back as ten years ago, was described as \u201csick in the head\u201d by one alleged victim, who notes that Burks alluded to having possibly infected as many as 300 victims. The victrim, who did not wish to be publicly identified, recalls that Burks has been on a \u201cdownward spiral\u201d since the death of his mother, and plies his prey with drugs and alcolhol, to \u201cbring their guard down.\u201d\n\nAccording to New York City Health Department spokesperson Kate Caraway, this is the first time a HIV infected individual has spread HIV to so many victims.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that anyone who may have injected drugs with, who may have had sex with him, does come forward and get tested,\u201d she Caraway. \u201cWe want to make sure that they\u2019re not spreading the virus to anyone else.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information regarding Burks\u2019 whereabouts is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 888-CRIMESC (888-274-6372). Your call will remain anonymous.\n\nThis makes the report we did on Craig Lamar Davis passing HIV around the Full Gospel Baptist Church seem like nothing.\n\nNow read Joshua Johnson story in his own words below:\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Burks aka Isaac Don Burks Pictured Above\n\nI met Stephawn, (Real Name: Isaac Burks \u2013 Isaac Don Burks), when I was 19 years old. I had just moved to Atlanta from North Carolina to attend Clark Atlanta University. At 19, I was still trying to figure out my sexual orientation. I was still a virgin, because I was raised with traditional values. I was attracted to females, but I was also attracted to men. In fact, my attraction to men was stronger. I desperately tried to fight my attraction to the same sex, because I knew if I gave in that would mean a lifetime as an outcast in my family.\n\nYou see, my father was a pastor and my mother was a physician. I came from a very stable background, and my parents were heavily into the church. They controlled everything in my life. They financed my education, sent me money every month, and paid virtually every bill that I had. They wanted to see me succeed in life, and I didn\u2019t want to disappoint them.\n\nWhen I moved to Atlanta I met other gay men who were more comfortable with their sexual orientation. I pulled strength from these men, and bonded with them immediately. They taught me that it was ok to be gay, and that life was too short to live my life for others. Over the next few months my circle started to consist of nothing but gay men. I felt comfortable. I felt that I could express myself without judgement, and\u2026. for the first time ever I felt accepted. As time passed by, I started coming out of the closet a little more each day. At first, I would never attend a gay club because of fear of being outed. My friends eventually talked me into attending a gay club for the first time. I was nervous! You see, I had a sister who attended Spelman College and four other male cousins who attended Clark. The last thing I needed was my family to find out my sexual orientation. That would mean the possibility of my parents cutting me completely off, and they were the ones paying for my tuition, books, and college expenses.\n\nI eventually put my fears aside after a night of drinking with my friends. We loaded up into my friends Ford Explorer and headed over to a club called Traxx. Apparently, this was the gay club that everyone in Atlanta attended on Saturday. I remember walking into a place that resembled a poorly decorated high school gym. It was huge! There had to be over 1,000 people in the place, and they were dancing the night away. Because we were underage, we couldn\u2019t drink. Apparently everyone over 21 received a special wrist band to indicate their age, and no one in my party had one. After awhile of standing around we were starting to become over it. Clubs aren\u2019t as fun when you are sober, and the liquor we had drank earlier was starting to wear off. While standing on the side I noticed a guy staring at me and smiling. He was very attractive, and every time I would catch him looking in my direction I would look the other way. This entire gay lifestyle was still new to me, so I didn\u2019t know what to take his stares for. Eventually he worked up the nerve to come over to me and strike up a conversation. He told me that I looked familiar, and asked me where I was from. I told him that I was from Charlotte North Carolina, and I couldn\u2019t possibly look familiar. I had never been to a gay club, and every one of my gay friends were college freshmen from different cities around the country. He asked me why I wasn\u2019t drinking, and I told him we couldn\u2019t buy drinks because we were all under 21. He offered to buy us a round of drinks at his expense. I jumped at the offer, because we wanted to enjoy ourselves that night. After all, no one comes to a club to have a bad time.\n\nHe returned minutes later with three drinks. The drinks he ordered for us were Long Island Iced Teas. I remember taking a sip and almost spitting the drink out. It was very strong. Rather than be rude and waste his money, I drank it slowly. Stephawn then asked why I was babysitting my drink. I asked what did he mean by that, because I had never heard the phrase used before. He told me to hurry up and finish my drink, he was going to order us another round. By the time the second round came, I was feeling nice. We continued to talk, and he kept buying me drinks.\n\nAfter the third round I was borderline drunk, and so were my friends. Every time he ordered me a drink, he also ordered my friends a drink too. After awhile my friends wanted to leave, and I told him that I would catch up with him later. He asked me to stay a little longer, and promised to take me home. I ditched my friends, and for the rest of the night it was just me and him.\n\nWe ended up leaving the club an hour later. While taking me home he told me that he wanted to stop by his house real quick to grab some gas money since his car was on E. We pulled into an apartment complex in the Lindbergh area of buckhead. He told me to come up with him so I did. As soon as the door to his apartment closed he started passionately kissing me. We eventually ended up in his bedroom where we kissed for hours it seemed. He started unbuckling my my pants, and I stopped him. I confessed that I was a virgin and didn\u2019t have a clue what I was doing.\n\nHe told me to relax, and that everything was cool. He said everyone started off as a virgin at some point in there life, and that he could teach me how to have sex. He made me turn over on my stomach and took my shoes off. Then he took my pants off. I was tense and nervous. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but he was so attractive I wanted every ounce of this man. The first thing he did was start eating my ass and I moaned passionately as he gently ate my ass for hours it seemed. Next he started sucking my d***k from the back while I was laying on my stomach. It felt amazing. I wanted to please him too, but he told me to chill and go with the flow. Then he started grinding on my ass and rubbing his d***k on my ass crack. He grabbed some lotion that was strategically placed on his nightstand. He rubbed the lotion in my ass crack, and then put some on his index finger. He slowly put his finger inside of my ass. I moaned in extacy, because he was stroking my d***k while he was massaging my prostate with his finger. After awhile of fingering me, he tried to put his d***k in my ass raw. I immediately stopped him! I asked if he had a condom, and he said yea why? I said because I didn\u2019t come to Atlanta to catch anything and safe sex was mandatory with me. He ran some line about being recently tested the week before, and I said that\u2019s cool but we just met. If we were going to have a casual encounter it needed to be a safe casual encounter. He jumped up and grabbed a magnum out of his dresser. I watched him put the condom on, and then I buried my face into the pillow. It was painful at first. I didn\u2019t understand how men could possibly enjoy what felt like having your insides ripped out. I had to stop him several times, because I could not take the pain. After about 20 minutes he was starting to get impatient. I couldn\u2019t take the d***k, and he seemed to be over waiting for me to get used to the pain. I didn\u2019t want to disappoint him, and I didn\u2019t want my first sexual experience to be horrible with my partner not being satisfied. I decided to \u201cman up\u201d and squirted some more lube on my ass. I laid on my stomach, and put my face back into the pillow. He inserted his d***k inside of my ass, and this time it didn\u2019t hurt as much. He started to increase his stroke, and I had no problem taking it. He was grabbing my waist, and I attempted to throw my ass back like I had seen in the porno movies. Whatever I was doing, he was enjoing it because he was moaning in extacy. After 10 minutes of f***king me doggy style he screamed he was going to cum. As he came I felt a warm liquid inside of my ass. I jumped up and looked back and saw his d***k without a condom on it! I screamed what happened to the condom? He grabbed around the bed and showed me the condom. There was no cum in it, and it was by the foot of the bed. I ran to the bathroom, because it felt like I had to s***t. When I used the bathroom, his cum rushed out of my ass. It was allot. I kept thinking to myself that this motherf***ker took the condom off while f***king me. That was the only explanation for cum being in my ass, because I watched him put the condom on.\n\nI came out of the bathroom with an angry look on my face. I said nigga I just used the bathroom and your cum came out of my ass. I asked him if he took the f***king condom off. He said no. He said that it must have broke. I wasn\u2019t buying it, and I searched around for the condom. I found the used condom on the bed, and started examining it. The condom wasn\u2019t broke at all! I rolled it out, and there was nothing wrong with it. I screamed what the f***k did you do, because this condom isn\u2019t broken. He told me that I was tripping, and I ran to the bathroom with the condom and put it up to the faucet. I filled the condom with water and it didn\u2019t leak at all! When I did that, he told me to get the f***k out of his house. I felt betrayed, I was scared for my life, and I was hurt. I had heard about Atlanta being one of the cities with the highest AIDS rates in the country, and I was determined not to be a statistic.\n\nI got my things, and got out of his house. This asshole didn\u2019t even take me home, and it was 6am in the morning. As I waited outside of his apartments in the cold, I called a cab service. They arrived about 20 minutes later and took me home. The entire time he was texting my phone and calling me non stop. I didn\u2019t answer his calls, because I didn\u2019t want to talk to him. I was convinced that he had purposely took the condom off while f***king me. There was no other explanation for his cum being inside of me. I know some guys get off by that, but I was disgusted by it.\n\nThe thought of his cum inside me made my stomach turn. As the liquor wore off, I went into a deep depression. When I got to my dorm, I popped two tylenol pm\u2019s and fell alseep.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone about my experience. How could I explain that I had sex and my partner purposely took the condom off and came inside my ass unprotected. I had just met this man. I didn\u2019t even know his real name. When my friends asked me what happened, I said nothing and gave them a look that said \u201cdon\u2019t ask me anymore questions!\u201d. They didn\u2019t ask, and I didn\u2019t tell. That experience frightened me so bad that I decided to put my sexual desires on hold and focused on my education. That meant pulling back from my \u201cgay friends\u201d too, because I was starting to get a little too reckless and free with my sexuality. I started hanging more with my straight friends. After all, I had to keep my charade up. I had family that attended my school, so I couldn\u2019t be seen with a bunch of gay men 24/7.\n\n8 months later while home for Christmas break I had to see my doctor for my yearly checkup. This was something my mother made me do ever year since I can remember. My doctor asked me was I sexually active, and I said no. I told him that I had sex once, but that was it. I wasn\u2019t sexually active, because I wasn\u2019t actively having sex. He told me that he was going to include an HIV test in my regular blood work anyway. A few days later I received a call from his office. It wasn\u2019t the doctor, it was one of the office workers. She was obviously new, because I didn\u2019t recognize her voice. She told me that I needed to come in, because there was something that the doctor needed to discuss with me. I was confused. I asked her what \u201csomething\u201d was, and she said that she couldn\u2019t release this information over the phone and that I should come in Today. This was very unusual, because I had never had this happen before and I had been getting a yearly checkup from the same doctor for over 15 years. At first I thought it could be high blood pressure, because that ran in my family. There was also a chance of cancer, because the women in my family had breast cancer and my grandfather passed away from prostate cancer. I borrowed my mothers car, and headed over to the doctor\u2019s office. I didn\u2019t want to scare her, so I didn\u2019t mention what I was borrowing the car for.\n\nI will never forget what happened next. As I arrived to my doctor\u2019s office, I was told to have a seat in the waiting room. There was soft music playing that turned out to be Barry Manilow\u2019s Daybreak, and it made my stomach turn! I hated that f***king song. I was in no mood to hear a happy go lucky song when I was being called into my doctor\u2019s office to discuss my lab results. Before the song could end, the doctor opened the door and escorted me to an exam room. It was cold, there was no window, and the light was very bright. Brighter than usual. He began to look over my charts and lab results. He grabbed my hand, which caught me off guard, and then said I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you this, but your HIV results\n\ncame back positive. I swear I didn\u2019t even hear the word positive, I just read his lips that seem to go in slow motion. I said, I\u2019m sorry but there must be some mistake. I am not sexually active. I\u2019ve only had sex once! I haven\u2019t had oral sex, or any sexual activity with anyone but one person. He said that he would order additional tests, and they all came back positive.\n\nI thought about committing suicide. I could not eat. I could not sleep. I could not focus on school. I couldn\u2019t do anything but cry. My doctor couldn\u2019t legally tell my mother I was HIV positive, but I was on her insurance so she would find out sooner or later when she saw the co-pays for the HIV meds he prescribed and the increased doctor visits. I tried to get in contact with Stephawn but his number was disconnected.\n\nWhen I got back to school, I went over to the apartment complex where he lived but I couldn\u2019t remember the apartment number. I had no way of reaching this guy. I wanted to kill him, and i was going to. I had a butcher knife and I was going to stab him thru the heart, because I knew this guy had given me HIV, because I didn\u2019t have sex with anyone else. As time passed, I became so depressed that I eventually dropped out of school. I kept thinking what is the purpose of getting a degree when I\u2019m going to die soon. I lost 15 pounds from not eating and started to look very frail. I decided to drop out of school, because I didn\u2019t know how to deal with it all. I had no one to turn to. I couldn\u2019t tell my friends, and I couldn\u2019t tell my parents. Can you imagine telling your mother that you are HIV positive after a one night stand. I couldn\u2019t dare to see the pain in her eyes of knowing her son is going to die before her.\n\nToday I read the article about Isaac Burks and saw his picture. This is the same guy who told me his name was Stephawn. This is the guy that gave me HIV! He ruined my life. I finally ended up telling my parents because I could not afford to pay the co-pays for the medication and doctor visits. My mother didn\u2019t cry, and told me that she loved me and would be there for me every step of the way. Later on that night as I got up to use the bathroom I heard her crying in her room. Tears immediately started pouring down my face and I ran to the kitchen. I slit my wrist. I wanted to die. I fell out and woke up in the hospital surrounded by my family. I have been in counseling, hiv support groups, and seeing a psychiatrist every since. Accepting the fact that I am HIV positive has been very hard. I still have not been able to return to school, and I have tried to kill myself 3 times since then.\n\nTo the sick f***k Isaac Burks, also known as Stephawn who gave me HIV, I hope you rott in hell. Now that I know his real name I will contact the authorities and tell my story. Every day I hope that things will get better, and it doesn\u2019t. I ask \u201cWhy me?\u201d every day. What did I do to deserve this? I have not been able to date or have any sexual relations with anyone. I just know the minute I tell them my HIV status they will be out of the door. I am going to die alone. The last time I tried to commit suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills I woke up to my mother crying and begging me to stop. But I cant. I have nothing to live for. I am alive, but I am not living.\n\nI cried as I typed this post. I relived it, but felt I had to share my story. After finally coming out to my friends with my story I later found out that there were others that this man infected with HIV.\n\n\n\nRead Isaac Don Burks Response on his Facebook Page Below:\n\nIsaac Don Burks Facebook Page\n\nI can only say i pray 4 the person or persons responsible for creating a false story about me spreading HIV to hundreds of people. I would love to get on here and bash every lie and false story that is floating around, but i have a life to live. I have friends and family who know and love me dearly and are in my corner. I am not a person who would intentionally bring pain and hurt to anyones life. I have seen what this disease does to people first hand losing my best-friend to this at such a young age. It baffles me to think that someone would actually have so much hate in their heart to make a factitious news article and take my past experiences to add more significance to the story. Loosing my mother was a very hard thing to deal with but to say im on a downward spiral of destruction because of this is outrageous. Im actually doing a lot better with my mother in heaven because with her watching over me this lie CANNOT WIN. See sometimes people are hurt so bad in life that they do things to others intentionally and maybe accidentally but this article was definitely intentional to hurt and assassinate my character and mainly make me out to be a monster. I pray for you whoever you are. See my GOD doesn\u2019t allow me to hate or to dwell in this foolishness with the serpent. I can say that i was always taught that the devil comes to steal, kill, and destroy. SATAN get behind me because no weapon formed against me shall prosper!!!!! For the ones who are spreading the story via internet i ask u WWJD, what if this was you or your brother, uncle, cousin, farther. I\u2019m not madd because i know who i am and im better then this. When your life is going so good things come to make u backslide into worldly ways but i want. I dont have anyhing else really to say besides GOD BLESS you all"

Ron Howard was to take on the role of Richie Cunningham once again, and other original actors include the guys who play Potsie and Malph, a cameo by Henry Winkler while Jon Voight plays Fonzie and an attractive guy who isn\u2019t worth less than the chick from Charles In Charge plays Chachi, who now loves a guy named Jeff.

	"text": "Mike Pence said he didn\u2019t understand why Michelle Obama had so passionately condemned his running mate, Donald Trump, for boasting about forcibly grabbing women by their genitals. The First Lady denounced the Republican presidential nominee, although she never dismissively spoke his name, for \u201cspeaking freely and openly about sexually predatory behavior\u201d \u2013 which she said had \u201cshaken (her) to the core.\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d Pence argued, \u201cI have no idea why Mrs. Obama, who will be departing the White House shortly, is even commenting on the future President of the United States, God-willing. That\u2019s the first thing I don\u2019t quite get. Secondly, if she\u2019s the First Lady, shouldn\u2019t she be focused on doing whatever it is that First Ladies are supposed to be doing as their duties while their husbands are rescuing the world? What\u2019s she doing commenting on and obviously worrying about her successor? That\u2019s not what she should be doing.\u201d\n\nThe governor of Indiana also said that she \u201chas no business\u201d commenting on men and their \u201crestroom talk,\u201d as well as that that\u2019s not \u201cladylike behavior.\u201d \u201cNow, I know that the word \u2018lady\u2019 is kind of in her job description, but it looks to me she\u2019s not behaving like one, at least as of late,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she was a real lady, she wouldn\u2019t be commenting on men\u2019s restroom talk and neglecting her own work and duties just so she could get a word out on a topic that she finds interesting for some reason.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cIf we had anyone else serving as the first lady, they would pretend like they hadn\u2019t heard it and would be going about their business in a normal fashion. But no, Michelle Obama is so vulgar she\u2019s not only being vocal about it, but she\u2019s also convinced that her job title will add weight and significance to her words. And she may be fooling those who can\u2019t see through her smoke screen, but the rest of us have her figured out. She can\u2019t fool me, just like she can\u2019t fool Donald Trump or any other conservative American who has the guts to think for himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many times do I have to repeat the fact that what he did and the language he used was just restroom talk?\u201d Pence asked. \u201cHe has apologized for it several times, and I really don\u2019t know what else people want him to do. And now you have countless media outlets spearheaded by the New York Times who are calling Donald a sexual predator. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, the first lady also thinks she\u2019s ordinary enough to be commenting on the issue as well. That\u2019s just ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way in hell Michelle Obama isn\u2019t working with the New York Times in a joint effort to smear the good name of Donald Trump, if you ask me. I refuse to believe all of these women who are popping up out of nowhere with stories that Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them are a random occurrence. This is too well organized to be an accident. And the entire Democratic Party is behind it, with the addition of their latest recruit, the soon-to-be ex-first lady Michelle Obama. And I\u2019m actually glad that\u2019s the case because when Donald wins, we\u2019ll offer all of them a job just for the fun of it,\u201d Pence concluded."

	"text": "Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public\n\nAustralia may become the first country in the world to microchip its public. NBC news predicted that all Americans would be microchipped by 2017, but it seems Australia may have already beaten them to it. Back in 2010, CBS news reported that the Australian government had a potential RFID microchipping plan in the works related to the health care system.\n\nNow, it seems that this plan is beginning to unfold but the push is not a result of mandated health care reforms, but rather a clever propaganda campaign that equates RFID microchipping with becoming superhuman, and people are begging for it.\n\nUnder the headline \u2018Australians embracing super-human microchip technology\u2019, Australia\u2019s premier media outlet news.com.au (News Corp Australia) reports: It may sound like sci-fi, but hundreds of Australians are turning themselves into super-humans who can unlock doors, turn on lights and log into computers with a wave of the hand.\n\nShanti Korporaal, from Sydney, is at the centre of the phenomenon after having two implants inserted under her skin. Now she can get into work and her car without carrying a card or keys, and says her ultimate goal is to completely do away with her wallet and cards.\n\nShe told news.com.au:\n\n\u201cYou could set up your life so you never have to worry about any password or PINs it\u2019s the same technology as Paypass, so I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll be able to pay for things with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Opal you get a unique identification number that could be programmed into the chip. Any door with a swipe card \u2026 it could open your computer, photocopier. Loyalty cards for shops are just another thing for your wallet.\u201d\n\nThe microchips, which are the size of a grain of rice, can act like a business card and transfer contact details to smartphones, and hold complex medical data. In her interview with the Australian news outlet, Shanti claims that her friends and family are envious of her microchip lifestyle:\n\n\u201cMy nana wants one. I\u2019ve had more opposition to my tattoos than I\u2019ve ever had to the chip. My friends are jealous.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the 27-year-old has noticed a business opportunity and set up a distribution service called Chip My Life with her husband, Skeeve Stevens where for just $80 to $140, people can become so called \u201csuper humans.\u201d On the same day this news story broke, Shanti appeared at Austarlia\u2019s launch of the much anticipated cyborg themed video game Deus Ex Mankind Divided, alongside American implantable technology pioneer Amal Graafstra.\n\nAs you can see, the push for RFID microchipping and assimilating the human population with robots and technology, is something that will most likely be sold to the public as helping them to become \u201csuper human,\u201d but clearly if you become part machine/computer, that means there will be someone who can control that technology. If you think the elites wouldn\u2019t capitalize on such an exceptional opportunity to control the population you obviously don\u2019t know history very well.\n\nAmal Graafstra, who became one of the world first RFID implantees back in 2005, just made headlines recently in the US with a prototype of the world\u2019s first implant-activated smart gun and is a huge proponent for this new technology.\n\nHe\u2019s written a book, spoken at TEDx and also appeared in a number of documentaries.\n\nIn an interview with the Australian media outlet, Amal explained that the technology he has implanted into his body has \u201cgiven me the ability to communicate with machines. It\u2019s literally integrated into who I am.\u201d\n\nShanti has bought into the culture that dominates society today, which is one dominated by the fantasy of super heroes that mesmerizes the population at theaters all across the globe.\n\nEver since watching movies like the Terminator, Matrix and Minority Report I wondered if we could actually live like that. I always wondered why we all weren\u2019t living as \u2018super-humans\u2019.\n\nClick to WATCH: Australia Becomes First Country To Begin Microchipping Its Public"

Some of the content on his computer indicate he may have been radicalized while he was studying in Muslim waters for his Captain Jack Sparrow role.\u201d\n\nThere you have it. If they found out Depp was a Muslim convert with plans to kill the President he may never see the light of day again. It\u2019s difficult to think of our favorite actors as such horrible people sometimes, but Hollywood is just filled with tree-hugging, self-righteous, Prius driving freaks.\n\nComments\n\ncomments"

	"text": "Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.\n\nIt looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person\u2019s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn\u2019t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.\n\nFact-checking largely didn\u2019t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don\u2019t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. \"We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,\" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.\n\nCNN has also released a statement: \u201cThe RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.\u201d But that still doesn\u2019t really verify that anything occurred.\n\n@solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an \u2014 RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016\n\n@solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa \u2014 RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016\n\nThe appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It\u2019s a layup for body-part puns.\n\nThis is exactly how fake news spreads\n\nBut this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it\u2019s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.\n\nThe stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won\u2019t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh."

Chelsea Clinton, the CEO, has been charged with fraud and a warrant issued for her arrest. But, following this news, Clintons were nowhere to be found for an interview.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the shutdown is the alleged \u2018\u2019pay for play\u2019\u2019 donations that saw rich and powerful terrorists gain access to Washington DC in exchange for cash. During Clinton\u2019s time as Secretary of State, it\u2019s been rumored that the 9/11 attack mastermind along with Obama Bin Laden were all invited to the White House residence for ice cream sundaes and an evening of Scattergories. Then, the creator of ISIS, Osama Bin Laden was sent to Cheyenne Mountain to be sent off-world and kept safe from prosecution while Obama and Clinton staged his death.\r\n\r\nSo, it all comes down to how Chelsea Clinton used her family foundation\u2019s cash to pay for her wedding, living expenses and taxes on gifts of cash from her parents. Doug Band, formerly a top aide to President Bill Clinton, griped about the former first daughter\u2019s spending in a Jan.4, 2012, email released by WikiLeaks.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents\u2026,\u201d Band wrote to John Podesta, now Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope that you will speak to her and end this. Once we go down this road\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nA chain of emails was hacked from Podesta\u2019s Gmail account and WikiLeaks has released more that 50,000 of the stolen emails over the past 32 days."

	"text": "The recently installed CEO of Donald Trump was accused of domestic violence against his second wife, who later said he threatened to leave her penniless unless she failed to testify against him. According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple\u2019s southern California home.\n\n\u201cI was wondering when this would come up,\u201d Bannon told Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we\u2019re on the subject, I\u2019m actually disappointed; I honestly didn\u2019t expect them to take this long,\u201d he said laughingly.\n\nAsked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, \u201cWell, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren\u2019t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it\u2019s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It\u2019s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.\u201d\n\nBut, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, \u201cAlright, look, that\u2019s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you\u2019re not supposed to in a relationship, that\u2019s the whole beauty of it. And just like there\u2019s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you\u2019re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I\u2019ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don\u2019t mean that in everyday life. I\u2019m talking about when they\u2019re performing their marital duties,\u201d he argued.\n\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s why I find these charges preposterous, they\u2019re so idiotic that I\u2019m not even sure how they\u2019re still interesting,\u201d Bannon added. \u201cBecause, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you\u2019re in love, everything\u2019s allowed, I don\u2019t care what anyone says, when you say the words \u2018I do,\u2019 and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible. At no point did I exceed my marital liberties, so why should I, or worse, why should Donald Trump be punished for it?\u201d he concluded.\n\nsource:politicops.com\n\nComments\n\ncomments"

We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it\u2019s a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you\u2019re prepared for.\n\nNASA has put out an ad looking for people who\u2019re willing to take part in their \u201cRest Studies\u201d \u2013 a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.\n\nSo what is the exact purpose of these studies?\n\nThese studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts\u2019 health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.\n\nThe Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.\n\nThis study is designed to achieve three core tasks:\n\nExamining how the astronauts\u2019 changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.\n\nExamining if the astronauts\u2019 physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.\n\nPreparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.\n\nThe study\u2019s participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.\n\nThe exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you\u2019re in the exercising or non-exercising group.\n\nOnce the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you\u2019ll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you\u2019ll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You\u2019ll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.\n\nDuring the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body\u2019s immunity system.\n\nBut is it worth it?\n\nYou may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can\u2019t take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.\n\nThis will probably be your only opportunity to say that you\u2019ve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back."

The barrel, which contained the arms, legs and heads of the three women, was filled with what the medical examiner calls a \u201ccrude preservative.\u201d\n\nThat means that whoever put them in there wanted to be able to visit them later.

One investigator called it \u201cthe weirdest thing he\u2019s ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe three women, all of whom were in their late teens or early 20s, were hitchhiking their way from California to New York in 1974 when they disappeared. Their last known location before heading back onto the road was a motel just outside of Little Rock.\n\nIs it a coincidence that three pretty young girls who disappeared so long ago from Arkansas ended up dead and buried on a property in upstate New York? It does if you talk to the Clintons PR people:\n\n\u201cBill and Hillary Clinton have nothing to do with this and welcome any investigation with open arms. They have offered the DOJ their full cooperation. You people and your conspiracy theories that everyone who dies in America must have had a run-in with Hillary or Bill Clinton need to sit down.\u201d\n\nInvestigators say while they don\u2019t yet have enough to charge Bill Clinton, they certainly have enough evidence to question him. When they approached the house to do their jobs, they were met by a team of lawyers and Secret Service personnel and told that unless they have some real evidence, Mr. Clinton was unavailable.\n\nThey added that he felt really bad for those girls but hoped at least now their families have closure. Clinton will use ignorance and the 5th amendment to once again try to get away with murder."

Marco Rubio used a question on abortion from a reporter to focus on Hillary Clinton, claiming she is the one with \u201cradical\u201d positions. Perhaps trying to show Rubio is out of step with voters on abortion, he was asked whether a fertilized egg should have legal protections, the candidate used the question as an opportunity to defend life and vigorously attacked the Democrat frontrunner.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking \u2013 I believe all life is worthy of the protection of our laws. That\u2019s what I believe,\u201d declared Rubio. Rubio, 44, is the youngest candidate in the Republican field, and has consistently declared he will defend life at all stages of conception, regardless of circumstances. \u201cI believe it is outrageous that Hillary Clinton supports partial-birth abortion, which is a gruesome process that\u2019s been outlawed in the United States, but she supports it as a process that should be legal,\u201d Rubio asserted.\n\n\n\nTaking another question from the audience, Rubio also took the opportunity to discuss rape victims by revealing he would \u201cput rape victims into custody and under strict supervision if it is determined that they are planning to have an abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just totally against the whole shebang, I won\u2019t deny it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI am appalled by how insensitive and self-centered rape victims can sometimes be.

They believe that every sperm cell is life, and ejaculation means killing all those babies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pro-life protesters are now asking the government to make a law which would make ejaculating for own gratification illegal throughout the USA. So many lives are lost only because men ejaculate watching p0rn videos on adult sites like Pornhub just to satisfy themselves. This is murder, there is an urgent need to protect the sperms, and the babies.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a petition was submitted on Change.org stating that sperm wastage due to self-satisfaction should be made illegal, and it has already received over 85,000 signatures.

	"text": "\u201cOne of the things that the Bible has consistently denounced is the taking of the Lord\u2019s name in vain. In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: \u201cYou shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain\u201d (Exodus 20:7). The word \u201cvain\u201d means \u201cfor no reason\u201d or \u201cuseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cThus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God\u2019s name was holy and should not be used for regular words.\n\n\u201cDr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that \u201cin this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.\u201d\n\n\u201cSaying the Lord\u2019s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,\u201d Hagee elaborated. \u201cBut, that\u2019s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don\u2019t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.\u201d\n\nThe pastor reprimanded: \u201cBut, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.\u201d\n\nAsked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: \u201cWell, we\u2019d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you\u2019re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God\u2019s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord\u2019s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God\u2019s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker\u2019s good name.\u201d/religionlo.com/\n\nComments\n\ncomments"

	"text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) \u2014 At a press conference early this morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced news of a presidential resignation happening within the next 30 days.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days,\u201d Ryan told reporters. \u201cAmid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.\u201d\n\nNews of this comes as Russia\u2019s hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 Election have become clearer. In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions.\n\n\u201cIf the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,\u201d Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. \u201cWashington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump took to Twitter , not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it.\n\n\u201cWe did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know you\u2019ll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think this is the best thing,\u201d Ryan continued. \u201cHe has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now it\u2019s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future.\u201d\n\nAfter word spread of Trump\u2019s impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter.\n\n\u201cI think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well. I never liked the man, never trusted him. Everyone knows that. Now Mike Pence, he\u2019s the President that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President.\u201d\n\nLloyd Glacier, a spokesman for \u2018Sock It Forward\u2018, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trump\u2019s plan to resign.\n\n\u201cThis will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.\u201d\n\n38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours,\u201d Horner said. \u201cTrump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. He was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now it\u2019s all gone. It looks like the heathenish masturbators have won and the Devil is extremely pleased. Just an FYI, you\u2019re all going to burn in Hell for eternity, but Jesus loves you very much! Praise Fappy!\u201d\n\nThe Trump Administration has setup a hotline for those wishing to voice any concerns or comments about Trump\u2019s impending resignation. That hotline\u2019s phone number is (785) 273-0329."

But this time, NASA confirms what\u2019s been circling the web recently \u2013 our planet Earth will experience total darkness for 15 days in November 2017 starting from November 15 to November 29.\r\n\r\nNASA reports that this strange occurrence was expected to happen but they didn\u2019t know exactly when. Upon more detailed examination the astronomers from NASA confirmed that the phenomenon will start on November 15 at 3:00 am and will most likely last until November 30, 4:45 pm.\r\nimages (4).jpg\r\nAccording to experts this blackout will be caused by an astronomical event between Jupiter and Venus. There was even a detailed 1000 pages document written by Charles Bolden, head of NASA explaining the strange event to officials at the White House.\r\nAccording to the report, during this specific period Jupiter and Venus will come in close proximity of each other and will be separated by just 1 degree. Venus will move to the south-west of Jupiter and as a result it will shine 10 times brighter than Jupiter. Venus\u2019 bright light will heat up the gases in Jupiter causing a reaction which will release a an absurdly high amount of hydrogen into the space. This reaction will come in contact with our Sun at 2:50 am on November 15th.\r\nOnce the hydrogen reaches the Sun, a massive explosion is bound to occur on the surface of the Sun, increasing the temperature to more than 9000 degrees. The whole process will generate so much heat that the Sun will change its color into a bluish shade. Once this happens, the Sun will need a minimum of 14 days to restore its normal color and temperature.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this strange phenomenon, the Sun\u2019s light will be seen much dimmer from the Earth and hence the 15-day blackout NASA is talking about.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do not expect any major effects from the Blackout event. The only effect this event will have on Earth is an increase of 6 \u2013 8 degrees in temperature. the polar cap will be mostly affected by this. No one should worry much. This event would be similar to what Alaskans experience in the winter\u201d, Bolden said."

Now that her tenure at Fox has ended and her new show is scheduled to start production sequences for a fall premiere, Kelly decided she wasn\u2019t happy and demanded the format be changed.\n\nAccording to Hugh McGovern, executive producer of Kelly\u2019s new show:\n\n\u201cMegyn had high hopes when she left Fox that people would still take her seriously as a journalist. She was lured to NBC with promises of easier days and evenings at home with the family. Now that she sees the production schedule, she feels like she\u2019s been duped and has demanded she be given more serious show assignments.\u201d\n\nThe problem, according to McGovern, is that Kelly sees a schedule filled with visits from celebrities and novelists to talk about their sitcoms and books, traveling assignments to dog shows and fashion week and even the addition of a musical guest. According to Maxwell Seawald, CEO of NBC Universal:\n\n\u201cMs. Kelly wants to be a journalist. Unfortunately, after her stint at Fox News and the way she attacked President Trump, she lost her following.

Trey Gowdy, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, suggested in a Friday interview that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe will be forced out at the top law enforcement agency as soon as next week.\r\n\r\nGowdy argued that newly released FBI records reveal political bias against President Donald Trump \u2014 and in favor of Hillary Clinton \u2014 at the highest levels of the FBI. Gowdy said that McCabe will likely be pushed out of the agency as a result of the perceived bias.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be a little bit surprised if he's still an employee of the FBI this time next week,\" Gowdy told Fox News of McCabe, adding that he would be \"shocked\" if McCabe testifies before the House next week.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post reported last week that Gowdy settled a $150,000 veteran discrimination and retaliation claim from a former aide, who was fired in 2015 from the House Benghazi committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The aide alleged that he was wrongfully terminated in part for his unwillingness to engage in what he believed was a partisan investigation into Hillary Clinton's time as US secretary of state.\r\n\r\n\r\nAttacks on special counsel Robert Mueller's team of investigators have escalated sharply in recent weeks, culminating in a partisan haranguing of the FBI director last week over the perceived missteps of his predecessor.\r\n\r\nConservative and far-right media outlets, already skeptical of Mueller's probe into President Donald Trump's ties to Russia, grew louder in their calls for FBI Director Chris Wray to either clean house or for Mueller to resign. It came after news that two special counsel investigators at one point exhibited perceived political bias.\r\n\r\nTrump again characterized the criminal justice system as \"rigged\" during a rally in Florida on Friday, echoing comments he made last weekend following former national security Michael Flynn's guilty plea as part of Mueller's probe.\r\n\r\nPresident Donald Trump lamented the state of the FBI, the nation's top law-enforcement agency, shortly before delivering a speech at an FBI graduation ceremony on Friday in Quantico, Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"It's a shame what's happened with the FBI, but we're going to rebuild the FBI. It'll be bigger and better than ever,\" Trump told reporters before boarding Virginia-bound Marine One on Friday morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe president also recently described the country's top law-enforcement agency as \"in tatters,\" but a White House spokesman said on Friday that Trump had \"full faith and confidence\" in the rank-and-file members of the Department of Justice and the FBI.\r\n\r\nAlso on Friday morning, Hogan Gidley, the White House's deputy press secretary, said that recently released FBI records showed \"extreme bias\" against Trump among leadership at the FBI.\r\n\r\nRecently disclosed text messages between two FBI agents assigned to the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with Trump's campaign included a reference to Trump as an \"idiot.\" Both agents are no longer involved in the Russia investigation. Other records revealed edits made to soften the statement of James Comey, then the FBI director, concerning the agency's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\r\n\r\nGidley called the records \"eye-opening\" and \"deeply troubling.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is extreme bias against this president with high-up members of the team there at the FBI who were investigating Hillary Clinton at the time,\" Gidley told \"Fox & Friends\" on Friday morning."

What, among those promises, should any Republican, nay any American, have a problem with?\n\nAfter four months without a single legislative achievement, Congressional and Senatorial Republicans \u2013 notably John McCain, Paul Ryan and Lindsey Graham \u2013 have joined the Democrats in investigating President Trump absent a single shred of evidence that an underlying crime has been committed.\n\nSo, what gives?\n\nWell, there was one additional promise that Trump made on his way to the White House that has some Republicans joining with Democrats and quaking in their boots, Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cDrain the Swamp.\u201d\n\nAs we reported yesterday, \u201cAn F.B.I. agent with \u2018intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the Clinton case\u2019 told us that they uncovered evidence of such massive corruption that the agents involved realized that damned near the entire government could be brought down.\u201d\n\nThe criminal co-conspirators in both parties realized almost immediately that the new sheriff wasn\u2019t interested in joining them in the swamp so they launched, what can only be characterized as, a coup attempt.\n\nDemocrats are well schooled in such things probably because of their close alliance with Marxist regimes that can only gain power by seizing it through bloody civil wars. It should be noted that the Democratic Party has already done this once before.\n\nOne Hundred and Fifty-Seven years ago the Democrats waged a war against the First Republican President Abraham Lincoln for giving Blacks their freedom. That war came at a high price, as many as 700,000 Americans died fighting for what they believe in. To put that in perspective, these casualties exceed the nation\u2019s loss in all its other wars, from the Revolution through Vietnam.\n\nToday, Americans are still prepared to fight and die to protect their children\u2019s God-given freedoms. Despite what you are reading and hearing in the mainstream media, they aren\u2019t the leftwing-funded rioters, the pussy hat-wearing feminists, or the cuck bois that cant handle a micro aggression. No, the Americans that back Donald Trump are well armed.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidency will move forward politically lest the sixty million patriots who voted for him, that are comprised of the large majority of military voters, police, and NRA members, move it forward by force.\n\nThese patriots are armed, trained, prepared, and have proven their discipline. They have grown disgusted by the corruption in Washington and will do whatever is necessary to make sure Trump\u2019s Freedom Agenda moves forward and under the direction of Donald Trump himself.\n\nNo amount of fake news based on unsubstantiated charges by unnamed sources is going to change that. The battle lines have been drawn and no amount of finger pointing is going to convince these patriots to let anyone overturn the election results.\n\nSo why are establishment politicians courting a bloodbath on the streets of America that will also threaten them personally when they could be part of Making America Great Again? It\u2019s because they have been caught red-handed and up to their eyeballs in a worldwide criminal conspiracy that has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with defrauding the American taxpayers.\n\nAnd, now that they\u2019ve been caught robbing the world\u2019s largest bank \u2013 the U.S. treasury \u2013 they have chosen to go out in a blaze of glory rather than try to defend the indefensible at trial.\n\nWashington\u2019s criminal elites have chosen to go to war to unseat our duly elected president. It\u2019s time to make our voices heard before this turns very ugly. Buckle your chin strap, America is counting on you.\n\nEDITORS NOTE: THIS IS NOT A CALL TO ARMS BUT RATHER AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE DEEP STATES OVERTURNS A DUELY ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n\nHERE IS A LIST OF EVERY SINGLE TIME OBAMA COMMITTED AN IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE THAT DEMS & MEDIA COVERED UP\n\n\u201cImpeach!\u201d It\u2019s been more than eight years since Democrats uttered that word \u2013 long enough for anyone to wonder if it was still in their vocabulary, considering the deafening silence through the dozens of serious scandals during President Obama\u2019s administration \u2013 but now that President Trump is the man in the White House, it\u2019s back with a vengeance.\n\nDemocrats everywhere are wildly slinging the \u201cI\u201d word, hoping to nail Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors after the New York Times claimed a memo written by former FBI Director James Comey said the president urged him to end the federal investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nSome members of Congress are getting in on the action. They include Reps. Maxine Water, D-Calif., and Al Green, D-Texas. Even a Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, claimed Wednesday there are grounds to impeach President Trump. House Oversign Committee Chair Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, asked for the alleged Comey memo and other documents. Chaffetz tweeted that he is prepared to subpoena the information. And Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., invoked \u201cWatergate.\u201d\n\nNow the Democratic Party is reportedly poll testing impeachment as a 2018 election issue. More than 1 million people signed a petition calling on Congress to impeach Trump.\n\nWasting no time Wednesday, the mainstream media sprang into action, enthusiastically echoing the left\u2019s impeachment calls. MSNBC launched a Watergate ad implying Trump is America\u2019s new Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cWatergate. We know its name because there were reporters who never stopped asking questions,\u201d says MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who hinted that Trump is next on the impeachment chopping block. \u201cNow, who knows where the questions will take us. But I know this: I\u2019m not going to stop asking them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, some overzealous members of the left plastered fliers around Washington, D.C., demanding all White House staffers resign Wednesday.\n\nThe posters read: \u201cIf you work for this White House you are complicit in hate-mongering, lies, corrupt taking of Americans\u2019 tax money via self-dealing and emoluments, and quite possibly federal crimes and treason. Also, any wars will be on your soul. \u2026 Resign now.\u201d\n\nBut constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, who voted for President Obama, warned \u201cimpeachment\u201d enthusiasts not to get ahead of themselves with President Trump. Why?\n\nAt this time, there\u2019s no evidence Trump actually committed a crime.\n\n\u201cThe criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo,\u201d Turley wrote in a May 17 opinion piece posted at the Hill. Turley explained:\n\nFor the first time, the Comey memo pushes the litany of controversies surrounding Trump into the scope of the United States criminal code.\n\nHowever, if this is food for obstruction of justice, it is still an awfully thin soup. Some commentators seem to be alleging criminal conduct in office or calling for impeachment before Trump completed the words of his inaugural oath of office. Not surprising, within minutes of the New York Times report, the response was a chorus of breathless \u201cgotcha\u201d announcements. But this memo is neither the Pentagon Papers nor the Watergate tapes. Indeed, it raises as many questions for Comey as it does Trump in terms of the alleged underlying conduct.\n\nA good place to start would be with the federal law, specifically 18 U.S.C. 1503. The criminal code demands more than what Comey reportedly describes in his memo. There are dozens of different variations of obstruction charges ranging from threatening witnesses to influencing jurors. None would fit this case. That leaves the omnibus provision on attempts to interfere with the \u201cdue administration of justice.\u201d\n\nHowever, that still leaves the need to show that the effort was to influence \u201ccorruptly\u201d when Trump could say that he did little but express concern for a longtime associate. The term \u201ccorruptly\u201d is actually defined differently under the various obstruction provisions, but it often involves a showing that someone acted \u201cwith the intent to secure an unlawful benefit for oneself or another.\u201d Encouraging leniency or advocating for an associate is improper but not necessarily seeking an unlawful benefit for him.\n\n.

Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.\n\nTrump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama\u2019s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:\n\n\u201cThe proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can\u2019t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.\u201d\n\nThe call, between Obama and Huma Abedin, was intercepted by the FBI after President Trump ordered Obama\u2019s phones tapped to catch him in a lie over the Russia scandal. That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will be pardoning him anytime soon."

	"text": "\"He didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about,\" Donald Trump said about Lester Holt. | Getty Post-debate, Trump team hits moderator Holt for 'some hostile questions'\n\nDonald Trump and his campaign complained Tuesday morning that debate moderator Lester Holt targeted him for unfair questioning while neglecting to ask Hillary Clinton about any of her various scandals.\n\n\u201cThey were leaving all of her little goodies out. They didn't ask her about, you know, much,\u201d Trump said on Fox News\u2019s \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cBut I was asked about my tax returns, which I've told about 500 times. But, you know, I think I did \u2014 I think I really did well when we were asked normal questions. I think I did really well in answering those questions, but those questions are not answerable in a positive light.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStill, Trump was upbeat overall about the debate, which he said \u201cwent really well\u201d despite \u201csome hostile questions.\u201d The Manhattan billionaire gave Holt a C+ for his performance as moderator, praising him for his issue-based questions in the first 45 minutes of the debate but attacking him as biased for a series of more direct questions about a housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump\u2019s real estate company in the 1970s, even though it was Clinton who brought up the Justice Department lawsuit.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think he did a bad job. You know, when you look at it, you watch the last four questions, he hit me on birther, he hit he on a housing deal from many years ago that I settled with no recourse and no guilt. He asked me about that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat's a beauty to be asked, you know, 40-year-old lawsuit, or older. I just hate to say it\u2019s older because then you\u2019ll know, then [Fox News anchor Ainsley Earhardt] will say \u201c\u2019Wow I didn\u2019t know Trump was that old.\u2019 Hey, she\u2019ll be unimpressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he didn't ask her about the emails at all. He didn't ask her about her scandals. He didn't ask her about the Benghazi deal that she destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn't ask her about a lot of things she should have been asked about. I mean, you know, there's no question about it. He didn't ask about her foundation.\u201d\n\nAttacking Holt became a running theme from Trump's campaign Tuesday morning, as both his running mate and campaign manager took to the morning shows to criticize the moderator.\n\n\"I was disappointed that Lester did not get into some of the issues that had been in so much of the forefront of Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy \u2013 the FBI investigation, pay to play, the whole disastrous events that took place in Benghazi and Libya \u2013 that never came up,\" GOP vice presidential candidate Mike Pence said on Good Morning America.\n\nTrump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway took a similar line, saying on CNN Tuesday that there were topics she wished Holt would have raised.\n\n\u201cI just would have liked to have heard more about Benghazi or e-mails or the Clinton foundation since these are very clearly in the news,\" she said. \"You know, one of our guests last night was Mark Geist, not Mark Cuban, Mark Geist, who's a Benghazi hero and survivor. And You know, he was within several feet or yards of them and I think it's a good reminder to be Americans of what her record is on that particular issue.\"\n\nWhile the Republican nominee insisted that he had outperformed Clinton at the debate, he said that he struggled throughout the night with a defective microphone that made him difficult to hear for the audience in the debate hall. Trump suggested that perhaps his microphone, which he said worked perfectly earlier in the day, had been tampered with.\n\n\u201cI had a problem with a microphone that didn't work. I don\u2019t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cMy microphone, in the room they couldn't hear me, you know, it was going on and off. Which isn't exactly great. I wonder if it was set up that way, but it was terrible.\u201d\n\nAsked if Clinton had successfully managed to get under his skin during their 90-minute back-and-forth, Trump said she had not until the end of the debate, when the former secretary of state brought up Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who Trump called \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201cMiss Housekeeping\u201d because of her Latin heritage. Addressing Trump directly about the name-calling, Clinton said, \u201cDonald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November.\"\n\n\u201cI know that person, that person was a Miss Universe person, and she was the worst we ever had. The worst, the absolute worst. She was impossible, and she was a Miss Universe contestant and ultimately a winner who they had a tremendously difficult time with as Miss Universe,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was the winner, and, you know, she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her, so Hillary went back into the years and she found this girl.

Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns within 15 days of receiving the party\u2019s nomination. It would also require the FEC would release the documents after 30 days, if a candidate did not. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here next week. We\u2019re probably going to have some downtime,\u201d Sen.Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we couldn\u2019t vote.\u201d\n\nDemocratic candidate Hillary Clinton and her husband the former President Bill Clinton have both disclosed over 30 years worth of tax returns, and all of the Clinton Foundation\u2019s returns too. In fact, since 1976 only one candidate has refused to release tax returns, and in that election Republican Gerald Ford kept his taxes secret, and left the Oval Office after losing to Democrat Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn the 2012 election, Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid voraciously and publicly called out Republican nominee Mitt Romney for only releasing two years of tax returns, saying that he was hiding his returns for over a decade and that the candidate had paid a very low or no tax on his income whatsoever. He was right!\n\nBut America only found out just one week before the election, long after the start of early voting and absentee ballot mailing, when Bloomberg News published a definitive article on Romney\u2019s taxes, which showed a huge income and no tax paid, validating the Democrat\u2019s numerous public statements. According to The Hill:\n\nMinority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who has called out the GOP presidential nominee nearly every day recently, added Thursday that Trump is \u201cethically compromised\u201d and the \u201cking of the welfare kings.\u201d\n\nIronically, Romney\u2019s father George Romney was a Republican candidate for President before him, and started the tradition of American politicians disclosing their financial details when running to become Commander in Chief.\n\nAmerican voters deserve to know what\u2019s inside Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s tax returns, to make the most informed votes possible. Because we all know every last detail about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s finances and personal history, but outside of lying, racism and narcissistic self-love, the orange-faced one is still a mystery.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!"

Rouhani said, \"Of course, throughout the atmosphere of presidential elections in the United States, candidates can bring up any topic that they see best suits the needs of their campaigns.

He's also called the Obama administration incompetent over it.\n\nClinton, on the other hand, has said she would respect the deal, yet be cautious in dealing with Iran, in what's come to be known as her \"distrust and verify\" strategy.\n\n\"No one can say here or there that I don't accept this agreement, I want to renegotiate it.

	"text": "Off Message Is Donald Trump qualified to be president? In the most pivotal moment of 2016, these are the questions he must answer.\n\nH.L. Mencken declared there was only one way to look at a politician \u2014 \u201cdown.\u201d\n\nLikewise, there\u2019s really only one way to look at the first presidential debate on Monday: as the first serious job interview for potential President Donald John Trump \u2014 an opaque candidate who has hidden behind a steel curtain of one-liners, faux familiarity and universal celebrity.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, it\u2019s a big night for Hillary Clinton too. She\u2019s got a lot to prove, for real, namely that she\u2019s not the lying, self-dealing crook many Americans think she is \u2014 or at least convince the 55 percent of voters who don\u2019t like her that her virtues (temperament and experience) compensate for decades of assorted ick. She needs to prove she can stand up to Trump, answer the usual email/foundation questions, convince whoever\u2019s still sellable on the idea (stop Instagramming a picture of your lunch, millennials, and listen up) that she\u2019s not some scheming granny who will just sell everybody out the second John Roberts drops the swearing-in Bible.\n\nBut the spotlight belongs on Trump, who is in need of a rigorous job interview. Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She\u2019s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.\n\nEveryone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box \u2014 running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He\u2019s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn\u2019t read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn\u2019t read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can\u2019t even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.\n\nThese are not nasty, biased, liberal opinions. They are facts based on reporting and Trump\u2019s own public performances. Here are five questions Trump needs to address on Monday \u2014 but taken together, they add up to one big one: Is Donald Trump qualified to be President of the United States?\n\n1. Does he actually know \u2014 or care to know \u2014 the basic information needed to competently run the country?\n\nOnly one verdict of presidential fitness counts, of course, and that\u2019s a candidate\u2019s capacity to get to 270 electoral votes. In recent days, Trump \u2014 who swooned after Clinton\u2019s superb convention in Philly \u2014 has closed to within the margin of error in many (though not all) national polls, and jumped to serious leads in battlegrounds like Ohio and Iowa since Aug. 1. He\u2019s still the most unpopular candidate in recent history (although Clinton is number two with a bullet) and seems to have a ceiling of between 40 and 44 percent nationally. But he can win. Fivethirtyeight.com, the arch-aggregator, gives Trump nearly a 50 percent chance of prevailing.\n\nHis resurgence proves three political points \u2014 two of them we knew, the third is a surprise to everyone except Trump and his team: The country (especially the white working-class parts) is pissed, Clinton is a perennially lousy candidate and \u2014 lastly, but not leastly \u2014 Trump has proven to be a resilient and flexible candidate with the capacity (developed late in the game) to shift shape and shut up when he needs to.\n\nThe first debate should be a pivot \u2014 from politicking to president-ing. Being a cunning candidate isn\u2019t remotely the same thing as being ready to rule \u2014 and we should be moving to the Doris Kearns Goodwin phase of the campaign, where the top priority is fitness to govern in a time of trial. It probably won\u2019t happen, but a boy can dream.\n\nThis is not to suggest that Trump can\u2019t do the job (Ronald Reagan, another entertainer who forayed into politics, was mostly a success), but he\u2019s been judged as a performer up to this point, and not subjected to the cold fluorescent scrutiny of managerial competence.\n\nTrump has repeatedly flubbed tests of his basic understanding of domestic and foreign affairs \u2014 apparently he wasn\u2019t aware Russia had annexed Crimea until George Stephanopoulos informed him recently. He obliterated Jeb Bush, that humbled patsy of the GOP establishment, in the debates \u2014 but Bush (if anyone had cared to listen) punctured Trump\u2019s bully-boy promise to impose tariffs on Chinese products, correctly pointing out that such a move would certainly spark countermeasures by Beijing that could lead to a global depression. Trump wasn\u2019t aware of that fact, or just didn\u2019t care.\n\nThe caring part is kind of important, if history is any guide. In April, I sat down with one of his longtime advisers, Roger Stone, who described what it was like to brief an executive whose prime attributes were supreme self-confidence and supreme impatience. \u201cAll you can do is present information and let him either assimilate it or not,\u201d said Stone, who has known the GOP nominee for decades. \u201cWhen you write something for him, keep it short and staccato. He's not going to read a 40-page white paper on the economy; zero chance of that. It's just too boring. Don't blame him; I don't like it either. So keep it simple and direct because that's the way he communicates.\u201d\n\nStone argued that Trump isn\u2019t an ignoramus \u2014 just a cut-to-the-chase decision-maker who is a lightning-quick study. But George W. Bush\u2019s advisers, speaking to biographer Peter Baker, said that Bush\u2019s unwillingness to ask probing, informed questions led to some of his disastrous decisions in Iraq. And during the nadir of the 2009 global economic meltdown, President Obama added a daily economic briefing to his daily national security rundown to keep tabs on the rapidly shifting metrics of crisis.\n\nTrump\u2019s capacity to intuitively assimilate information might render such processes useless \u2014 but there\u2019s not a single presidential historian drawing oxygen who believes a lack of intellectual curiosity is an asset for the job.\n\nMany Americans might not give a damn that he knows what HUD\u2019s Section 8 program is \u2014 and his failure to answer informational questions that Clinton would parry with ease will endear him to his screw-the-media base. But don\u2019t people have the right to know what he actually knows? Trump has gleefully trashed the rules of presidential campaigns, so why should a moderator treat him with the deference of someone who abides by the norms \u2014 by assuming he possesses the basic knowledge traditionally required of a presidential candidate?\n\n2. Does Trump understand and respect the basic principles and traditions of American Constitutional government?\n\nAgain, this is not a given. Hillary Clinton despises the press, and dodges them as if they were a pack of feral rats, but she has never suggested they be stopped from doing their jobs through the courts. Trump (who banned news outlets, including this one, from his events for most of the campaign) routinely threatens litigation against publications that publish unflattering articles and, in February, went so far as to say: \u201cWe're going to open up those libel laws. So when The New York Times writes a hit piece which is a total disgrace \u2026 we can sue them and win money instead of having no chance of winning because they're totally protected.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a new one for a presidential nominee. As Corey Brettschneider wrote in POLITICO Magazine last month: \u201cFor more than 50 years, the Supreme Court has held that for a public figure to prove libel against a news outlet, they must show that the outlet acted with \u2018actual malice\u2019 \u2014 that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\u201d\n\nDuring a private meeting with Hill Republicans earlier this year, the populist real estate developer expressed his fondness for \u201cArticle 12 of the Constitution.\u201d The framers stopped at seven. \u201cHe was just listing out numbers,\u201d said Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-Texas), a Trump backer at the time. \u201cI think he was confusing Articles and Amendments.\u201d\n\nOK, let\u2019s write that one off as a gotcha \u2014 you can understand Constitutional principles without citing literal chapter and verse. But consider his reaction to the Paris bombings last November when Trump told FOX News he thought the government should shutter some mosques where \u201csome bad things are happening.\u201d The comment was decried by Constitutional scholars of all stripes as a radical measure that would violate the \u201cFree Exercise\u201d clause of the First Amendment, a pillar of protection for faiths of all kinds.\n\n3. Why won\u2019t Trump forthrightly answer the most basic questions about his businesses and debts?\n\nHillary Clinton has, appropriately, has come under intense scrutiny for her six-figure speeches to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs \u2014 and has refused to release the transcripts of her prattles to the plutocrats. And serious questions remain about the lack of boundaries between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and big-money foreign donors who blurred the line between influence peddling and altruism.\n\nBut the Clintons have released all of their tax returns (in part because, for many years, they were required to do so as government employees) and Trump is the first major presidential candidate in the modern era to thumb his nose at handing over a single one.\n\nWhy does it matter? Because a guy whose purchase on the presidency is rooted in his private-sector acumen needs to back up his claims with proof, in the same way that Clinton needs to be held accountable for her purported record of accomplishment in the White House, Senate and State Department. At issue is Trump\u2019s fundamental personal narrative, and his claim that he\u2019s \u201cvery, very rich.\u201d He is, but maybe not quite as much as he claims (he says he\u2019s good for $11 billion; Forbes and other outlets say he\u2019s worth less than half that much).\n\nMore serious is the issue of Trump\u2019s debts: The Clinton campaign, citing press reports that he owes large sums to overseas creditors in China and elsewhere, has attacked him for being in the pocket of foreign financial overlords. If that\u2019s a lie, there\u2019s an easy way to prove it \u2014 by releasing the returns.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a liberal media witch-hunt: Many Republicans, including supporters like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say he needs to cough them up, and fast.\n\n4. What\u2019s the deal with his charitable foundation? Then there\u2019s the matter of Trump\u2019s sloppily run, and less-than-magnanimous foundation. In expos\u00e9 after expos\u00e9, Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has reported on a pattern of over-promising donations and the misuse of funds (including a quarter-million payment to cover legal fees for Trump\u2019s businesses and sports memorabilia) that Trump himself has conceded might be illegal.\n\nThe problem, yet again, is that Trump has refused to release a comprehensive accounting of his giving, and his surrogates have routinely misstated the magnitude of his generosity, according to the reporting of Fahrenthold and others.\n\n5. Why lie? These days, the polygraph is used sparingly as part of the vetting process for employment, mostly for sensitive national security or law enforcement jobs. If presidential candidates were subjected to that level of scrutiny, the only person allowed on the debate stage at Hofstra would be the technician testing the sound system.\n\nBut if Trump is to be vetted for the presidency, he needs to be asked not only about individual statements he\u2019s made in the past, but his pattern of lying, stretching the truth and bungling facts.\n\nHillary Clinton (\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d in Trump\u2019s parlance) it bears repeating, is no saint \u2014 far from it \u2014 and her early answers on the email scandal were misleading, bordering on the untruthful, and flat-out lies in the view of GOP congressional investigators.\n\nBut it\u2019s a crowning irony of 2016 that the Republican Party, whose base revolted against its leadership for untruthfulness \u2014 especially George W. Bush\u2019s claims about Iraq \u2014 would nominate the most brazenly truth-challenged candidate in recent history. (A recitation of Trump\u2019s whoppers would take up too much space \u2013 read POLITICO\u2019s comprehensive \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Week of Misrepresentations, Exaggerations and Half-Truths\u201d for a taste.)\n\nIn an attempt to defend Trump, buddy Newt Gingrich, who lobbied to be Trump\u2019s running mate, tweeted what amounted to an indirect admission that his man has a trouble with all those pesky facts. \u201cClinton,\u201d the former speaker wrote, \u201cis a fox who knows many things you can fact check. Trump is a hedgehog who knows one big thing\u2026\u201d\n\nBut getting the facts right \u2014 and telling the truth \u2014 is a big thing. It\u2019s the only way citizens will ever look up to, and not down on, their leaders.\n\nAuthors:"

If nothing else, it limits the candidate's exposure to hard-hitting questions -- while fueling frustration among journalists.\n\nTrump's surrogates continue to say that he is more accessible than Hillary Clinton, but that is no longer true.\n\nNewt Gingrich knocked Clinton at a Trump rally on Monday afternoon by saying \"she doesn't do press conferences.\" But Clinton has taken questions from reporters at half a dozen press conferences in the past two weeks, including as recently as Monday morning.\n\nThese sessions, while relatively short, have been plentiful, while Trump has not held a press conference since July.\n\nTrump beat reporters are starting to make noise about the drought \u2014 especially since Trump made Clinton's eight-month period without press conferences into a major campaign talking point.\n\n\"It's been more than 50 days since Donald Trump held a press conference,\" David Martosko of The Daily Mail tweeted Monday.\n\nTrump's recent TV appearances, on \"The Dr. Oz Show\" and \"The Tonight Show,\" made news, but not in journalistic settings.\n\nThe Washington Post's Robert Costa had a newsmaking interview with Trump last week. But that's the exception to the rule. The New York Times last had an interview with Trump about a month ago.\n\nTrump last appeared on CNN in late August. Because Anderson Cooper challenged Trump about the candidate's muddled stance on immigration, The Post's Callum Borchers concluded that \"it didn't go very well\" for Trump.\n\n\"It went so not well, in fact, that you have to wonder whether his campaign will decide it's best to dodge the likes of Anderson Cooper and Chuck Todd \u2014 or, for that matter, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier \u2014 and stick to softball sessions with Sean Hannity and the 'Fox & Friends' crew,\" Borchers wrote afterwards.\n\nTrump's last time on NBC was the \"Commander in Chief Forum\" on September 7. Moderator Matt Lauer was widely criticized for his light touch with Trump.\n\nRelated: Behind the scenes, NBC execs concede Matt Lauer forum performance was \"disaster\"\n\nThe candidate's last time on ABC was a short interview with David Muir on September 6. His last time on CBS was a \"60 Minutes\" sit-down with Lesley Stahl on July 17.\n\nTrump does have another CBS interview in the works, a campaign spokeswoman said.\n\nTV networks are agitating for more interviews with both Trump and Clinton. The difference between the two is that Trump previously had a reputation for calling in to morning shows and sitting down with interviewers all the time.\n\nThis accessibility also once extended to his traveling press corps.\n\n\"Trump used to be very, very accessible to the press. At the beginning of his campaign, he was extremely accessible,\" CNN politics reporter Jeremy Diamond said on Sunday's \"Reliable Sources.\" \"You could catch him for quick interviews on the way in and out of rallies. And that has really changed.\"\n\nDiamond said \"he is less accessible I think, in many regards, than Hillary Clinton at this point.\"\n\nTrump's campaign declined to comment Monday on its media strategy. Republican communications strategist Ron Bonjean said most candidates in Trump's position would be \"trying to reach a a broader general election audience.\"\n\n\"However, most Americans already know Trump as a household name and he doesn't need to diversify his interviews for additional exposure,\" Bonjean said. \"Trump is protecting himself from less friendly journalists while getting out his message at the same time even if it is to a more conservative audience.\"\n\nThis conservative-focused media strategy is also gaining attention among Trump's critics. \"He pretty much exclusively appears on Fox News now,\" Judd Legum, editor of the liberal news site ThinkProgress, tweeted on Monday.\n\nTrump's relationship with Hannity is perhaps the best symbol of how the candidate gets out his message on his own terms. Trump has taped numerous town halls with the conservative commentator.\n\nAccording to TVNewser, Wednesday's town hall will focus on \"issues and concerns surrounding African-Americans this election cycle.\"\n\nAccording to Nielsen data, only 1.5% of Hannity's 2 million nightly viewers are African American. Overall, at any given time of day, about 2% of Fox News viewers are African American."

And it needs to become intolerable.\"\n\nThe Democratic nominee added: \"I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.\"\n\nEven as she referred to the deaths as \"two very upsetting incidents,\" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.\n\nRead More"

	"text": "Last week I wrote an article titled \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s Amazing Week\u201d which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore.\n\nThe latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%. The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the \u201ctoss up state\u201d category.\n\nDonald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia. Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump\u2019s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum. The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program. Lower income families will also benefit from the plan\u2019s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year. Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns. Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent\u2019s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care. Finally, Trump\u2019s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent\u2019s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent.\n\nDonald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York\u2019s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump\u2019s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump\u2019s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health following her fainting at last week\u2019s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump\u2019s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women. So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton\u2019s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump.\n\nTrump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something \u201cunpresidential\u201d. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could \u201cmess up his hair\u201d. While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned, the fact that Trump said \u201cyes\u201d to the display speaks volumes. He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the \u201cTrump Train\u201d. Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his. However small, it\u2019s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box.\n\nNow if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients. Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed \u201ctwo years early and under budget\u201d, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the \u201cbirther issue\u201d. Trump took the microphone and said \u201cNot to mention her in the same breath,\u201d (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) \u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.\u201d Trump said.\n\nOnce again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another \u201camazing week.\u201d\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com"

	"text": "2016 Obama\u2019s team isn\u2019t laughing at Trump anymore The president\u2019s aides worry the Republican represents more of America than a fringe.\n\nObamaworld laughed as it watched Donald Trump\u2019s hostile takeover of the GOP. After eight years of Republican opposition, inconsistent policy demands and racialized hate against the first black president, President Barack Obama\u2019s aides, past and present, thought Republicans had gotten what they deserved--and more, all but forfeiting the 2016 race to the woman they defeated eight years ago.\n\nThey\u2019re not laughing anymore.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGoing into Monday night\u2019s debate, Obama\u2019s team is feeling that same anxiety expressed by some top Hillary Clinton aides: maybe the country isn\u2019t what they thought, maybe the resistance to Obamacare and gay marriage and the progress they\u2019re so proud of is broader than the vocal fringe they\u2019ve always dismissed. Maybe, the president\u2019s aides \u2013 current and former \u2013 now concede, they\u2019re going to have to live with the fact that Trump could end up in the Oval Office in part due to a backlash against Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to think of a series to compare it to, which was a series that started as a comedy and became a high stakes drama,\u201d said Ben LaBolt, a former White House aide and press secretary for Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re maybe in the fifth season of \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 here. We\u2019re way beyond the laughs, and just sitting on the edge of our seats in terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere's not a lot of mirth in the circles I run in about him,\u201d said another former senior Obama campaign staffer.\n\nPrivately, Obama has expressed mixed feelings, according to people close to the president. He\u2019s still nursing amusement at Republicans for being hapless enough to get railroaded by Trump, but it\u2019s mixed with frustration that there are so many Americans he failed to reach. People who've spoken to him say the president wonders what he might have done differently to break through in a way that would make people who\u2019ve benefited from his policies\u2014like those enjoying added health benefits courtesy of Obamacare\u2014support Democrats.\n\nFor Obamaworld staffers who had just been starting to settle into a new buoyancy about the president's climbing approval numbers, Trump\u2019s growing strength is an agonizing reminder of how far short they have fallen in delivering on \u2018hope.' Even if Clinton wins, the Republican has shown not only that America is divided between red and blue but that there\u2019s an America that Obama never connected with at all, and where all his data and rational arguments and appeals to sensibilities are as useless as Monopoly money.\n\n\u201cWe are still the country that elected Barack Obama in 2008, and we are capable of that and more,\u201d said Jim Papa, a former special assistant for legislative affairs in the White House. \u201cBut we\u2019re also capable of making bad choices and being seduced by someone who plays to fears and anxieties and racial differences.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s already done things they never thought he could, like mainstreaming racist rhetoric and racking up so many small donors that they worry about the extent of his support. And that was even before he riled up Obama doubters again with his birther pirouette.\n\nAnd the result: Trump\u2019s doing better in the polls at this late stage than Obama\u2019s team imagined. With 43 days to go, Trump and Clinton are essentially tied, polls sitting within the margin of error, even in battleground states.\n\nThough only a few weeks ago, current and former Obama aides would joke about how the president\u2019s great political legacy might be the Republican Party destroying itself in front of him. Now, on the record, they push back on the very suggestion that Obama\u2019s legacy should be viewed in any frame that Trump also occupies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he thinks it\u2019s his legacy, I don\u2019t think any of us think it\u2019s his legacy,\u201d said Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to the president. \u201cTrumpism is a lot of things in this country. President Obama is the face of that for some Republicans, but the Republican Party got themselves into this mess.\u201d\n\nBut they worry about what even a Trump loss says about Obama\u2019s America.\n\n\u201cI think he will lose badly in this election, but I think the impact he\u2019s had on our political process is incredibly damaging, and will be lasting,\u201d said Tommy Vietor, a former national security spokesman who noted that his own amusement at Trump ended a year ago. \u201cHe\u2019s made us look stupid. I think he is stupid.\u201d\n\nFor any efforts Obama made in urging people to disagree without being disagreeable, as the president likes to say, \u201cTrump has shattered that,\u201d Vietor said. \u201cHe has brought back a brand of politics that is you punch your opponent as hard as you can, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a low blow, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s not of substance. That\u2019s a bad lesson for people to learn.\u201d\n\nAccording to Earnest, Obama is serious about wanting a functional opposition and wishes that he\u2019d had one to negotiate with on immigration reform, trade, infrastructure and other priorities. The sense of lost opportunity eats at them, as does the sense that it\u2019s not going away, despite their confidence in Clinton\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying we\u2019d all be playing acoustic guitar in a circle on the National Mall, but I am saying we would have progress to show for our efforts,\u201d said White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who's been with the president since the first campaign.\n\nNot everyone\u2019s inside Obamaworld is down. Some schadenfreude remains.\n\n\u201cHe's still exposed and ripped apart factions of the GOP, enhanced their brand as hostile to a rising electorates, and will leave them with no infrastructure,\u201d said a more upbeat former Obama 2008 campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan.\n\nAnd Democrats\u2019 sense of the vacuous GOP that Trump represents continues to resonate, particularly as they see the Republican nominee attack an economy that\u2019s gone wrong with the support of many of the same people who opposed the policies that the president credits for the economic rebound that includes the longest period of sustained growth and taxpayers repaid with interest from the bailouts that caused so much trouble.\n\n\u201cThe eight-year legacy of the recovery from the Great Recession is clear evidence that the Tea Party movement,\u201d said Earnest, \u201cis intellectually bankrupt\u2014or about something other than the economy.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn't take care of their grief about the state of American politics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather live in a world where the two parties really compete,\u201d Papa said, \u201cthan have a political edge on the Republican Party but have to live in a world where white supremacists have a channel and are legitimized.\u201d\n\nAuthors:"

	"text": "The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said that 858 people who were ordered to be deported or removed instead eventually received citizenship. | AP Photo U.S. mistakenly granted citizenship to hundreds of immigrants\n\nAt least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general announced Monday.\n\nThe mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI\u2019s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI\u2019s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau.\n\nThe inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only \"potentially\" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship.\n\n\"It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,\" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. \"Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.\"\n\nIn at least three cases, the inspector general\u2019s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for \u201csecurity-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.\u201d The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked.\n\n\u201cThis situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,\u201d Inspector General John Roth said. \u201cTo prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.\u201d\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from \u201cany nation that has been compromised by terrorism.\u201d\n\nAuthors:"

One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble \u2014 to protest. However, that\u2019s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don\u2019t understand what the words \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d mean.

Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That\u2019s not a protest; it\u2019s a riot. And it doesn\u2019t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn\u2019t fix anything.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It\u2019s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension."

	"text": "On Saturday, September 17 at 8:30 pm EST, an explosion rocked West 23 Street in Manhattan, in the neighborhood commonly referred to as Chelsea, injuring 29 people, smashing windows and initiating street closures. There were no fatalities. Officials maintain that a homemade bomb, which had been placed in a dumpster, created the explosion. The explosive device was removed by the police at 2:25 am and was sent to a lab in Quantico, Virginia for analysis. A second device, which has been described as a \u201cpressure cooker\u201d device similar to the device used for the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, was found on West 27th Street between the Avenues of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. By Sunday morning, all 29 people had been released from the hospital. The Chelsea incident came on the heels of an incident Saturday morning in Seaside Heights, New Jersey where a bomb exploded in a trash can along a route where thousands of runners were present to run a 5K Marine Corps charity race. There were no casualties. By Sunday afternoon, law enforcement had learned that the NY and NJ explosives were traced to the same person.\n\nGiven that we are now living in a world where acts of terrorism are increasingly more prevalent, when a bomb goes off, our first thought usually goes to the possibility of terrorism. After all, in the last year alone, we have had several significant incidents with a massive number of casualties and injuries in Paris, San Bernardino California, Orlando Florida and Nice, to name a few. And of course, last week we remembered the 15th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks where close to 3,000 people were killed at the hands of terrorists. However, we also live in a world where political correctness is the order of the day and the fear of being labeled a racist supersedes our natural instincts towards self-preservation which, of course, includes identifying the evil-doers. Isn\u2019t that how crimes are solved? Law enforcement tries to identify and locate the perpetrators of the crime or the \u201cbad guys.\u201d Unfortunately, our leadership \u2013 who ostensibly wants to protect us \u2013 finds their hands and their tongues tied. They are not allowed to be specific about their potential hypotheses for fear of offending anyone.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2013 who famously ended \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d profiling in his city \u2013 was extremely cautious when making his first remarks following the Chelsea neighborhood explosion. \u201cThere is no specific and credible threat to New York City from any terror organization,\u201d de Blasio said late Saturday at the news conference. \u201cWe believe at this point in this time this was an intentional act. I want to assure all New Yorkers that the NYPD and \u2026 agencies are at full alert\u201d, he said. Isn\u2019t \u201can intentional act\u201d terrorism? We may not know whether it is from an international terrorist group such as ISIS, or a homegrown terrorist organization or a deranged individual or group of individuals. It is still terrorism. It is not an accident. James O\u2019Neill, the New York City Police Commissioner had already ruled out the possibility that the explosion was caused by a natural gas leak at the time the Mayor made his comments. New York\u2019s Governor Andrew Cuomo was a little more direct than de Blasio saying that there was no evidence of international terrorism and that no specific groups had claimed responsibility. However, he did say that it is a question of how the word \u201cterrorism\u201d is defined. \u201cA bomb exploding in New York is obviously an act of terrorism.\u201d Cuomo hit the nail on the head, but why did need to clarify and caveat before making his \u201cobvious\u201d assessment?\n\nThe two candidates for president Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump also weighed in on the Chelsea explosion. Clinton was very generic in her response saying that \u201cwe need to do everything we can to support our first responders \u2013 also to pray for the victims\u201d and that \u201cwe need to let this investigation unfold.\u201d Trump was more direct. \u201cI must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what\u2019s going on,\u201d he said. \u201cBut boy we are living in a time\u2014we better get very tough folks. We better get very, very tough. It\u2019s a terrible thing that\u2019s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, an incident like the Chelsea explosion reminds us how vulnerable our country is particularly in venues defined as \u201csoft targets.\u201d Now more than ever, America needs strong leadership which is laser-focused on protecting her citizens from terrorist attacks of all genres and is not afraid of being politically incorrect.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com"

He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nA U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.\n\nFormer classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.\n\nOne of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a \"pretty normal guy.\" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.\n\nRahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nThe Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.\n\n\"I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,\" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. \"He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.\"\n\nMembers of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.\n\nInvestigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nIn August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer \"has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,\" but Rahami was not indicted.\n\nToday Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.\n\nLate Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.\n\nA senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.\n\nNew Jersey State Police\n\nABC News' Cindy Galli, Megan Christie, Randy Kreider, Alex Hosenball and Cho Park contributed to this report.\n\n[Editor's Note Sept. 28, 2016: The original version of this report said that Ahmad Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000. Rahami's father later told ABC News, however, that his son and the family came in 1995 and that Rahami received his Green Card in 2000.]"

	"text": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is making one plea ahead of Monday night\u2019s big debate: Don\u2019t let Donald Trump get away with it.\n\nAnd Trump\u2019s campaign is firing right back, arguing that the press is biased against the Republican nominee and, in any case, Clinton\u2019s team is just trying to \u201cgame the refs.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe debate is playing out against a backdrop of polls that indicate a tightening White House race, with Trump drawing even or ahead in national and battleground-state surveys. Polling averages now show that Clinton\u2019s post-convention lead has evaporated, and no less a guru than Nate Silver declared on Monday morning that the race is a \u201cdead heat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe latest polling is consistent with a Clinton lead of only ~1% nationally. State firewall breaking up. Trend lines awful,\u201d Silver tweeted.\n\nDuring the critical hours of expectation-setting ahead of the 9 p.m. showdown at Hofstra University, both camps claimed their candidate would be held to an unfair standard, with Clinton\u2019s aides explicitly requesting that moderator Lester Holt fact-check Trump in real time.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned that Donald Trump may lie, he may throw misinformation out there, and that Hillary will have to spend all of her time trying to correct the record rather than talking about the things she wants to accomplish,\u201d Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d adding that all the campaign is asking of Holt is that if Trump lies, \u201cthat that simply be checked.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe thing that concerns us is not the moderator themselves, who have been selected by the commission, because they will be seen as fair and even-handed. What bothers us, Mark, is the very public and very coordinated attempt to game the refs,\" Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway shot back in an interview on MSNBC.\n\nBut Conway was soon put in the awkward position of defending Trump\u2019s claim that Holt may be unfair to him because he\u2019s a Democrat and the system is \u201cvery unfair.\u201d The \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d anchor has been a registered Republican in New York since 2003.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that he knew what Lester Holt\u2019s voter registration was,\u201d said Conway, who went on to dodge multiple queries of why Trump lied. \u201cHe didn\u2019t lie,\u201d Conway said at one point, explaining that \u201ca lie would mean that he knew the man\u2019s party registration.\u201d\n\nIn a presidential cycle that\u2019s seen endless debates about debates, Monday\u2019s theme was conflicting interpretations of what it means to be a moderator. After suggesting a debate with no moderator, Trump has already signaled to Holt that he shouldn\u2019t try to be Candy Crowley, who famously injected herself into the 2012 presidential debate between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney with a fact-check of the GOP nominee.\n\nBut Clinton\u2019s campaign has beat up on Holt\u2019s NBC colleague Matt Lauer, who was widely panned in the media for allowing Trump\u2019s false assertion that he didn\u2019t support the Iraq war go unchecked during a national security forum earlier this month.\n\nView One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Hillary Clinton fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nThe nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates, which selected the debate sites and moderators, weighed in Sunday. \u201cIn our history, the moderators have found it appropriate to let the candidates be the ones that talk about the accuracy or the fairness of what the other candidate or candidates might have said,\u201d Janet Brown, the commission\u2019s executive director, told CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to fact-checking, Brown warned, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopedia Britannica.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Clinton won\u2019t let Trump\u2019s lies \u201cgo by the wayside,\u201d press secretary Brian Fallon told CNN on Monday, insisting that Holt shouldn\u2019t, either.\n\n\u201cThere is enough lies that Donald Trump tells consistently that everyone, by now, should be able to call them out,\u201d he said. \u201cLester Holt, Hillary Clinton will, too, but I think that even the observers and reporters tonight watching that are grading the two candidates\u2019 performances should take it into account. By now, we all know he likes to lie about his record when it comes to the Iraq war, he lies about his support for the intervention in Libya, he lies about who started birtherism, he lies on any different number of issues and he tells them so frequently that we all know them now. If he says them again, that should be disqualifying. He can\u2019t possibly be given a passing grade if he repeats those lies.\u201d\n\nFormer Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a paid CNN contributor who is still receiving severance from the Trump campaign, dismissed the idea that a fact-checking moderator is of any concern.\n\n\u201cI think what the concern is from both of the campaigns \u2014 and what it should be \u2014 is that the moderator is not the person who\u2019s running for president of the United States. So I think you let the candidates debate, you let the candidates answer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can hold people accountable, there\u2019s no question, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the role of the moderator to inject themselves in so they\u2019re making themselves part of the debate structure and people are talking about the moderator after the debate.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign, including his former aide Lewandowski, also pushed the narrative that Clinton is robotic. That charge was leveled in response to the Clinton camp\u2019s preparation for two Trumps.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want Donald Trump\u2019s lies and distortions to be a distraction. We\u2019re hoping that can get checked so that Hillary can focus her time on what she wants to do,\u201d Mook told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nAsked about Clinton\u2019s rules of engagement versus Trump, Mook added that \u201cit just depends on what Donald Trump shows up to the debate, and we just don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\nView One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016) One week of Donald Trump fact-checks (September 24, 2016)\n\nBut Conway shot down the notion that there\u2019s any other Trump, while echoing the criticism that the former secretary of state lacks human compassion. Lewandowski cast Clinton as a policy wonk whose challenge is \u201cto become human\u201d during the debate, senior communications adviser Jason Miller tweeted that \u201cOverprogramming leads to short circuits,\u201d and Conway joined the pile-on.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be robotic and scripted. Hillary Clinton is,\u201d Conway said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a problem in debates likes this because people want to see a future commander in chief and president of the United States who is nimble and resilient and can answer questions that haven\u2019t been pre-programmed in their head through all this secretive debate prep and mock debates.\u201d\n\nAfter Mook warned against \u201ca double standard where Donald Trump can get the Most Improved award but Hillary Clinton, you know, is getting judged on the fine points of policy,\u201d Conway added that the two campaign managers \u201care living in parallel universes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, Donald Trump has been criticized all weekend long. I think that the Clinton campaign has clearly been gaming the refs, has been talking to the media for a week now saying it\u2019s your job to make sure that Donald Trump is fact-checked in real-time,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm just surprised a campaign manager would try to lower expectations that dramatically for his own candidate. But look, they know that campaign debates are not Hillary Clinton's sweet spot. Yes, she's experienced at doing them, but the experience hasn\u2019t necessarily been beneficial.\u201d\n\nAside from how Holt will moderate, Conway cited pre-written narratives and what she claimed was Clinton\u2019s willingness to say anything to get elected as her top concerns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that some of the headlines are already written, that they\u2019re conclusions in search of evidence,\u201d Conway said, adding that newspapers and reporters have already begun trying to undercut Trump ahead of the debate.\n\n\u201cWhat I would ask you all to do is start looking at the Twitter feeds of, quote, objective reporters, particularly our embeds. These are not profiles in courage, and this is not journalism. There are people who cover our campaign who actually just slander our candidate on Twitter,\u201d Conway said. \u201cNinety-two percent of at least two of our embeds\u2019 tweets are negative towards Donald Trump. Why are they on our campaign plane? Why are they covering our campaign? ... Excuse the Trump campaign if we feel like we can\u2019t get a fair shake from certain people.\u201d\n\nConway also indicated that Clinton may play the woman card, skewing headlines that take away from the real estate mogul\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cSo if she ends up saying to him, \u2018That\u2019s just not true, you\u2019re distorting my record, you\u2019re being mean to a woman,\u2019 and then people will say, \u2018He was mean to a woman,\u2019 and the headlines will scream and Twitter will blow up \u2014 even if it\u2019s not true,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that would be my concern, that he\u2019s not able to get out all of his responses because, as Joe [Scarborough] correctly points out, people are so worried that she\u2019s not a great debater, that she\u2019s not really ready for tonight the way he is, that she\u2019s going to try to interrupt him and confuse the people watching in such a way that he was somehow rude to a woman and he somehow lied on the stage.\u201d\n\nRudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor and a prominent Trump surrogate, said he had advised Trump to \"just let loose\" and be himself \u2014 and not try to compete with Clinton's detailed policy expertise.\n\n\"She's been in government since I was a child. I don't remember a time she hasn't been in government in one way or another,\" Giuliani said on \"Fox and Friends.\" \"So she's going to have obviously more specific knowledge than he has, but I think he's going to comport himself very, very well, and he's going to be \u2014 he's just going to be like you see him on \u2014 when he comes here [on Fox News] and when you talk to him on the phone. He's going to be Donald Trump.\"\n\nAuthors:"

	"text": "I was a Democrat all my life. I came to Washington to serve President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy. When the president was murdered and his brother struck off on his own, I joined his Senate campaign and staff as his legislative assistant and speechwriter, until his presidential campaign ended with his own assassination. I ran on a (losing) Democratic ticket in the New York state elections of 1970. When I was working to enact my own program of police reform in the 1980s and 1990s, then-Governor Bill Clinton was chairman of my National Committee for the Police Corps.\n\nThis year, I will vote to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSo profound a change, and a decent respect for old friendships, requires me to deliver a public accounting for this decision.\n\nHere it is. John and Robert Kennedy devoted their greatest commitments and energies to the prevention of war and the preservation of peace. To them that was not an abstract formula but the necessary foundation of human life. But today\u2019s Democrats have become the Party of War: a home for arms merchants, mercenaries, academic war planners, lobbyists for every foreign intervention, promoters of color revolutions, failed generals, exploiters of the natural resources of corrupt governments. We have American military bases in 80 countries, and there are now American military personnel on the ground in about 130 countries, a remarkable achievement since there are only 192 recognized countries. Generals and admirals announce our national policies. Theater commanders are our principal ambassadors. Our first answer to trouble or opposition of any kind seems always to be a military movement or action.\n\nNor has the Democratic Party candidate for president this year, Hillary Clinton, sought peace. Instead she has pushed America into successive invasions, successive efforts at \u201cregime change.\u201d She has sought to prevent Americans from seeking friendship or cooperation with President Vladimir Putin of Russia by characterizing him as \u201canother Hitler.\u201d She proclaims herself ready to invade Syria immediately after taking the oath of office. Her shadow War Cabinet brims with the architects of war and disaster for the past decades, the neocons who led us to our present pass, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Yemen, in Ukraine, unrepentant of all past errors, ready to resume it all with fresh trillions and fresh blood. And the Democrats she leads seem intent on worsening relations with Russia, for example by sending American warships into the Black Sea, or by introducing nuclear weapons ever closer to Russia itself.\n\nIn fact, in all the years of the so-called War on Terror, only one potential American president has had the intelligence, the vision, the sheer sanity to see that America cannot fight the entire world at once; who sees that America\u2019s natural and necessary allies in this fight must include the advanced and civilized nations that are most exposed and experienced in their own terror wars, and have the requisite military power and willingness to use it. Only one American candidate has pointed out how senseless it is to seek confrontation with Russia and China, at the same time that we are trying to suppress the very jihadist movements that they also are attacking.\n\nThat candidate is Donald Trump. Throughout this campaign, he has said that as president, he would quickly sit down with President Putin and seek relaxation of tensions between our nations, and possible collaboration in the fight against terrorists. On this ground alone, he marks himself as greatly superior to all his competitors, earlier in the primaries and now in the general election.\n\nIt must also be said: Mr. Trump is an imperfect candidate, and he would surely be an imperfect president. He is crude, often vulgar. He has areas of great ignorance. He insults people and inflicts unnecessary harm. He would be twice the candidate he is if he used half the words. He is often intemperate; though it is not Trump but his opponent who is so intemperate as to compare Putin\u2019s moves in Ukraine to what Hitler did\u2014an insult that throughout all the Cold War and to this day, no American president has ever offered to any Soviet or Russian leader, not even the enormous butcher Josef Stalin, with whom in fact we joined to win the Second World War. And it is not Mr. Trump but Michael Morell, a former CIA director now high in the councils of the Democratic candidate, who has publicly suggested, without rebuke from anyone, that we should begin \u201ckilling Russians,\u201d a doubly illegal act of war.\n\nMoreover Trump marks himself as a man of singular political courage, willing to defy the hysteria of the Washington war hawks, the establishment and the mainstream media who daily describe him as virtually anti-American for daring to voice ideas and opinions at variance with their one-note devotion to war.\n\n***\n\nJohn Kennedy admired political courage. He began his first campaign for Congress at the height of the Cold War by saying, \u201cAbove all, day and night, with every ounce of ingenuity and industry we possess, we must work for peace. We must not have another war.\u201d Years later, in the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, he and his brother had to overcome great opposition from their own military commanders, government officials and other public leaders, to prevent a war with the Soviet Union: there were 13 men in the ExComm room, and Robert Kennedy said that had any 1 of 8 of them been president, the crisis would have exploded in nuclear war.\n\nBut within a year thereafter, deeply affected by the barely-averted catastrophe, President Kennedy had forged a close working relationship with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, spoke all over the country to promote peace policies, and delivered his historic American University speech of 1963. Our \u201cstrategy of peace,\u201d he said, was \u201cnot a Pax Americana enforced on the world by American weapons of war.\u201d Rather it must be founded on negotiation, cooperation in areas of mutual interest, and recognition that \u201cour most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children\u2019s future. And we are all mortal.\u201d As to our great adversary the Soviet Union, he said, \u201cwe must reexamine our own attitude\u2014as individuals and as a nation\u2014for our attitude is as essential as theirs.\u201d\n\nSix months later he was dead; and it was Robert Kennedy who must resume the effort. Robert Kennedy made ratification of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty the early centerpiece of his Senate career. But as President Lyndon Johnson escalated the war in Vietnam, it was that war which forced Robert Kennedy to make his doomed race for the presidency. Wherever he campaigned in 1968, to virtually every audience, he spoke of the loss, the horror, the infinite tragedy of that war, in words that could be and must be repeated today, after 15 consecutive years of wars all over the world.\n\n\u201cOur brave young men,\u201d he said, \u201care dying in the swamps of Southeast Asia. Which of them might have written a poem? Which of them might have cured cancer? Which of them might have played in a World Series or given us the gift of laughter from the stage or helped build a bridge or a university? Which of them would have taught a child to read? It is our responsibility to let these men live ... It is indecent if they die because of the empty vanity of their country.\u201d\n\nHe also urged that we consider the Vietnamese mother, desperately trying to shield her baby from the fire from the sky, sent by machines from a country she could barely understand. He demanded of his colleagues, on the Senate floor, to answer what gave us the right to destroy remote villages on the other side of the world, to arrogate to ourselves the power of God, the rule of life and death over others. \u201cAll this is our responsibility,\u201d he said, \u201cnot just a nation\u2019s responsibility but yours and mine.\u201d\n\nJohn and Robert Kennedy were no pacifists, nor ignorant of the realities of power. But they required that great power be used with great precision and restraint, and with humility. Both knew that their own lives were hostage to the possibility of assassination, yet they kept trying to guide us toward peace up to the moments of their death.\n\nThe legacy of JFK & RFK is \u201cbeing abandoned by today\u2019s Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nTheirs is the legacy that is being abandoned by today\u2019s Democratic Party. We have broken one Middle Eastern nation after another. Hundreds of cities and villages lie in ruins, hundreds of thousands are dead, millions are refugees; and, for all the press and political thundering against the menace of ISIS, Al Qaeda, or Islamic terrorism generally, our military leaders offer no prospects of victory. They cannot tell us what victory would require or mean; though they are quick to assure us, as in Libya today, that this conflict will go on indefinitely. They cannot even explain how some of our current allies (example Turkey) are bombing and shelling others of our purported allies (example the Kurds). So a Democratic administration, carrying on the work of the Bush presidency, without thought and without question, year after year, has kept sending more young men and women into the grinder.\n\nScores of Democratic elected officials once spoke and worked tirelessly to end our disastrous war in Vietnam. Today there is only the voice of the marvelous Democratic member of Congress Tulsi Gabbard, a reservist who has twice deployed to Iraq and knows of what she speaks. And it is a Democratic president who sends an endless parade of drones to nations all over the world, flaunting for all to see America\u2019s unique military technology, coupled with our seeming complete carelessness in how that technological prowess destroys people and nations.\n\nMost amazing of all, however, is that as we proclaim that the terrorists threaten Europe, threaten the United States, threaten Western civilization itself\u2014as we face all this, we do not concentrate our military might against this unique threat.\n\nWhere are we sending our warriors, our ships, our planes? Why to Russia, which the U.S. general who commands NATO has announced is the prime \u201cexistential\u201d threat to America. As you read this, ground, air and naval forces of NATO, led and largely paid for by the United States, have been moving about the Western borders of Russia, carrying out the largest military maneuvers since World War II. At the same time, our most powerful carriers and naval air forces have been steaming about the South China Sea, there perhaps to find encounters of unknowable potential with the rising forces of China, our second said to be \u201cexistential\u201d enemy.\n\nThere are no Russian terrorists ravaging France or Italy or America. ISIS is not to be found on Russian soil. The only Russian terrorists who have attacked the West are the Islamists whom President Putin first asked us to join in the fight against in 1999. The only Chinese terrorists are Uighurs who are attacking not us but China itself. It would seem elementary common sense that America would have long since sought, not to fight with Russia and China, but to cooperate with both to suppress the terrorists and the terrorism that have plagued us for over a generation, including the ISIS that is terrorizing Europe today.\n\nFormer Defense Secretary William Perry, a Democrat, warns that we are now, today, \u201con the threshold of a new Cold War. ... a new nuclear arms race. ... the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is actually greater than it was during the Cold War.\u201d\n\nSurely the wars and threats of war already on our horizon would be more than enough for any empire; and our empire, as every thoughtful person knows, is already staggering under the immeasurable loads of debt piled up by America, by our governments, our corporations, our households, our students, and our promises of unlimited benefits in the future. The years of constant combat have exhausted our military. False hopes and vain promises of victory have burnt up the caches of idealism and patriotic commitment with which we began the wars a generation ago. Our forces are worn out, especially the elite warrior units that have been constantly deployed for more than a decade.\n\nBut, ominously, there is more to come, more that already stares us in the face. The dire events of this summer have shown us the true danger that lurks here at home. This is not a danger imported from Syria or Iraq or Russia. Our greatest menace is the danger of our own history, our inheritance to the latest day.\n\nFor the fact is that while we chased a chimera of peace and justice in lands far from our own, imposing ourselves and our concepts on strangers who rejected our teachings, we were neglecting our own country and our own people, our own neighbors, our own children and our own friends. And now we can see the result. The violence we took to other countries bounces back to our own. The money we squandered on bombs in Iraq was not available for our own schools. The brilliant young men and women, who gave up their bodies and their lives on distant battlefields, were not here to teach and mentor and guide the young people of the ghetto. They were not here to police the mean streets, to suppress and eliminate the crime that is the greatest cause of poverty. They were not here to bring the protection and the blessings of the American Constitution to the least among us. They were not here to protect American cities and enrich American lives.\n\nAnd they were not here to keep Americans and American children from murdering American police officers. This is our true present danger.\n\n***\n\nSo my hope for America is this. First, we must begin immediately to end our involvement in endless, unnecessary and therefore murderous wars. We need our best young people to help us here at home. We need to stop the reckless military spending on more destructive armaments. We need to breathe free again.\n\nWe must and will defend civilized order against its deadly enemies. ISIS and its brethren must be eliminated: no quarter, no hesitation. But we will need to engage all civilized peoples in our mutual defense. We must abandon foolish skirmishes and petty jealousies. We must end our reflexive efforts to dominate other developed nations, especially Russia and China.\n\nPresident Kennedy told us over and over that our own peace and security, in this dangerous world, would depend upon peaceful and cooperative relations with Russia and the Russian people; indeed, at the end of his presidency, Ronald Reagan said the same. Fools in Washington, intent on world domination, would have us ignore that wisdom now. But it is the wisdom that we need to preserve the world and our children\u2019s future.\n\nSecond, we must at the same time begin to recover our domestic peace. There are many ills to be cured, many shortcomings to be righted.\n\nBut nothing can be accomplished in the midst of a war against police, an insurrection against the Constitution itself. Our clear priority is reinforcement of our police and police departments. We need many more and better police. We need them to be better trained, not as warriors but as shepherds, as leaders and teachers of the young, as peacemakers in communities that have not known real peace for many years. We need our very best young people, not getting their legs blown off by IEDs in Afghanistan, but saving all of our lives in St. Louis and Chicago and Detroit and Baton Rouge and all the other wasted places in our own land.\n\nDonald Trump has been mocked mercilessly for saying, \u201cAmerica first.\u201d But to demand that all the actions of government, at home or abroad, be first directed at the interests and well-being of our own country is not old-fashioned or outmoded. Rather it represents the deepest wisdom and tradition of American statesmen from the founders on. Only with a clear vision of what is truly in the interests of our nation and our fellow citizens, and a full commitment to those interests, can we act wisely at home and in the world beyond.\n\nFinally, our president has told us we must lower our voices. Of course we do not hope for domestic discord. But the people of the United States have perhaps stood silent for too long. The elites of opinion and government have not hesitated to offer us instruction, from the heights of their power and eminence. These are the people who have led us into useless foreign war and limitless domestic disaster. This president tells us that we must now spend another trillion dollars on new nuclear weapons systems, and when we ask who will be the target for these world-destroying weapons, says only, \u201cThere can be no business as usual with Russia.\u201d\n\nSurely he must have misspoken, for anyone can see we are on a course of madness. We simply cannot fight the entire world, Russia and China and all the nations of the Mideast, and fight a war at home all at the same time.\n\nAnd therefore we citizens must not be silent, we must speak as with one great overwhelming voice, a voice as powerful as Washington, as Jefferson, as Lincoln, as Martin Luther King:\n\nReturn to the wisdom of the founders, who fought necessary wars to defend the Union, but sought no foreign conquests.\n\nDo not step over the threshold of a new Cold War, a new nuclear arms race with Russia and China, but seek to enlist them in common ventures to resist the forces of terror and chaos that threaten all civilization.\n\nCommit to our own domestic peace and security, rather than persist in a vain effort to control the lives and affairs of 200 foreign nations.\n\nThis, as I understand it, is the platform of Donald Trump. It was not the Republican Party platform, and he had to overcome much opposition within his party to gain the nomination. But it is his platform. It is the platform he has restated again and again, with determination, and with the courage and persistence to outlast his critics. It is a platform that, even in these troubled days, could fulfill the hopes of the greatest Americans of all parties.\n\nWell may we seek reassurance whether Mr. Trump has the kind of cool judgment and self-possession that the presidency requires; the judgment that comes to the fore in crisis, that saves a nation or perhaps a world. No one can ever truly know how a future president will react to such enormous pressures. But Trump has given some evidence. He set himself a unique course toward the office, disdaining conventional wisdom, speaking more truth about politics and about America than any conventional consultant or adviser thought prudent or wise. And yet it is his independence, his willingness to name facts however unpleasant, together with his great political courage, that can give us hope and even some confidence that he may be up to the job. Perhaps most important, he has proven that he is not intimidated by the generals and admirals who have up to this day had their unimpeded way with our wars and our budgets, to the immense loss of both.\n\nFlawed as he may be, Trump is telling more of the truth than politicians of our day. Most important, he offers a path away from constant war, a path of businesslike accommodation with all reasonable people and nations, concentrating our forces and efforts against the true enemies of civilization. Thus, to dwell on his faults and errors is to evade the great questions of war and peace, life and death for our people and our country. You and I will have to compensate for his deficits of civility, in return for peace, we may hope as Lincoln hoped, among ourselves and with all nations.\n\nTruly, America first, last and always; for ourselves and for our posterity. These are the reasons why I will vote for Donald Trump for president.\n\nAdam Walinsky worked in the Department of Justice during the Kennedy administration and later served as legislative assistant and speechwriter to Sen.

I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it\u2019s a presidential virtue,\u201d Conway told MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe Tuesday. \u201cTo tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton \u2018I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.\u2019 That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWith just minutes left in Monday night\u2019s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as \u201ca man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.\u201d After the debate, Trump told CNN that \u201c\u201cI was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,\u201d indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton\u2019s husband and daughter in the audience.\n\nTuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump\u2019s attack might have been.\n\n\u201cI think he could have said what was on millions of Americans\u2019 minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who\u2019s been good to women and who hasn't?\u201d Conway said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.\u201d\n\nOverall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a \u201cknockout punch\u201d that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump\u2019s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Conway said.\n\n\u201cI don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,\u201d she added. \u201cSo I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.\u201d\n\nAuthors:"

He didn\u2019t go that route.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOf Trump\u2019s statement on Obama\u2019s birthplace, Arpaio added: \u201cIt didn\u2019t bother me.\u201d\n\nArpaio, a prominent Trump supporter known for his hard-line views on immigration, opened an investigation into the legitimacy of Obama\u2019s birth certificate in August 2011, several months after the White House published it online, further demonstrating that he was, in fact, born in Hawaii.\n\nTrump rose to political prominence in part through insinuating, falsely, that Obama was not born in the United States \u2014 a claim the president\u2019s supporters have long decried as racist. He backed down from it under pressure last week, in a short statement at an otherwise drawn-out press conference at his new luxury hotel in Washington. Trump also attempted to blame his opponent, Hillary Clinton, for starting the rumor, another claim independent fact checkers have debunked.\n\nBut while Trump has sought to sidestep the birther issue, Arpaio has refused to back down from his own claim that Obama\u2019s birth certificate was forged. On Tuesday in Phoenix, Arpaio addressed the conservative group that requested he investigate the document, saying that \u201cwe are looking at a forged document. Period.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Arpaio told POLITICO the investigation into the document is ongoing. He declined to detail what evidence that effort has turned up, but he claimed that his office has found nothing \u201cto say it\u2019s a legitimate document.\u201d\n\nArpaio also tried to separate himself from the birther movement, arguing that his investigation is focused on the document itself, rather than the president\u2019s birthplace, and denied that his skepticism is motivated by racism.\n\nStill, he would not say that he believes Obama was born in the U.S.\n\n\u201cI have no idea now where he was born,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cYou hear a lot of stories.\u201d\n\nHe and Trump did not discuss the birth certificate issue before the nominee held the press conference last week, Arpaio said.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know he was going to say it,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthors:"

	"text": "Getty Images Wealth Of Nations Trump vs. Clinton: A Fundamental Clash over How the Economy Works He sees it as zero-sum. She believes all boats rise together. Hillary is right, but a lot of people are buying into Trump\u2019s vision.\n\nAs he made clear once again in Monday night\u2019s debate, Donald Trump sees the world in zero-sum terms\u2014when one person or one country wins, another always loses. Asked by NBC\u2019s Lester Holt how to help American workers, Trump responded in his usual way, saying America was getting beaten by everyone else around the world, and the NAFTA free-trade deal was \u201cone of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. ... We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton, by contrast, sees the world as a place where all boats can rise at once\u2014as she also made plain Monday by harking back to Bill Clinton\u2019s pro-globalization presidency, which included NAFTA. \u2018I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again,\u201d she said. \u201cIncomes went up for everybody.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat is the election of 2016 distilled down to its essence. \u201cMy whole life is about winning. \u2026 I always win,\u201d Trump says in explaining why he\u2019s running. The economic plan on his website begins with the rubric \u201cWinning the Global Competition.\u201d You don\u2019t get more zero-sum than that.\n\nDespite the view of most economists that the economy overall is not a zero-sum game\u2014but rather a complex mechanism that, if run right, can raise everyone\u2019s welfare at once\u2013Trump\u2019s message has resonated in an era when it\u2019s become common to speak of winners and losers in the global economy. The zero-sum message fits neatly with the widespread reality that many millions have been severely harmed by the transitions in our economy over the past decades. As Danny Vinik recently noted in Politico, the gap between those who are thriving in the new economies of today and those who are not continues to grow.\n\nThe recent Census Report that showed a 5.2 percent increase in real median income between 2014 and 2015 was taken by many as proof that the narrative of an America in decline and losing is fundamentally flawed. Statistically, if the United States is one unit, that is true. But 320 million people have a huge variety of experiences ill-suited to one size fit all numbers, and while the averages and medians may go up or down, that says nothing about the lived experience of tens of millions who diverge from that one number. And the experience of a goodly portion of what was the industrial heartland and what was the epicenter of the mid-2000s housing bubble is unequivocally negative, insecure and economically grim.\n\nHence, you have the sense that those who perceive themselves as winners in the global economy are trending towards the Democrats, while those who think they\u2019ve lost are going toward Trump. There is some truth there, but that isn\u2019t a sufficient explanation for why, for instance, massive percentages of African-Americans and Latinos, who have certainly struggled economically and socially, support Clinton.\n\nNo, what is most striking about this election is the degree to which the electorate is polarized not between winners and losers per se but between those who view the world in such zero-sum terms, like Trump, and those who sense that it is possible to multiply the numbers of \u201cwinners\u201d without creating a commensurate number of losers. That has been the mantra of Clinton and her predecessors in the Democratic Party, and it was also the foundation of Ronald Reagan\u2019s appeal. The belief that the economic pie can expand year after year and embrace ever more people has also backed up by a generation of economists who argue that open trade and globalization makes the whole world wealthier.\n\nHillary Clinton has continued to deliver that message. At the Democratic Convention in July she spoke of an America thriving with economic opportunity, with millions working hard and succeeding. President Obama has also been at pains to highlight the innovations of Silicon Valley, the revival of many cities in the past decade, and the substantial gains on the other side of 2008-2009 financial crisis. Judging from polls and surveys, those who fit that description \u2013 clustered and concentrated in large metro areas, and on the coasts especially \u2013 support Clinton and the Democrats by wide margins.\n\n***\n\nIs either side right? Most economists see the liberal internationalist order backed by the law establishing the rules of engagement in free markets as a key element to the emergence of a several billion-strong global middle class. In general, that view is correct. But it still tends to gloss over just how wrenching it is to be among the tens of millions in the United States caught in the vortex of rapid change. It does these global laggards no good to say that they have bigger homes and longer lives and more possessions than their grandparents. They legitimately fear that they will lose those homes, be unable to afford healthcare, that they will see their communities crumble and their children\u2019s hopes extinguished. And they see a world of others who appear to be doing better, who seem to be winning, and a political establishment that has promised everything and delivered what feels like nothing.\n\nThe voice of the so-called losers in this global competition is as loud, politically speaking, as it\u2019s been in a long time. Hence Trump (not to mention Bernie Sanders\u2019 powerful insurgency in the Democratic primaries). The last time so many in the United States were so sour about the inequities between those winning (the few) and those losing was at the dawn of the Progressive Movement in the 1890s. Many early Progressives rebelled against an elite vision of Social Darwinism then prevalent which said that the strong and the best thrive while the rest manage to eke out what they can. In 1896, the scion of that view was William Jennings Bryan, who painted a picture of the United States every bit as bleak and dark as Trump with his thundering about elites on the coasts crucifying hard worker labor and farmers on a \u201ccross of gold.\u201d Bryan lost two elections, and his zero-sum view never came to dominate American politics. Much of his message about inequality and the need to reform the system, however, was taken up by Theodore Roosevelt and generations of both Republicans and Democrats. Some of it harsh and redistributive, focused on trust busting and exerting American influence and prestige abroad, and much of it was about expanding opportunities for all.\n\nTrump also enjoys a good deal of sub-rosa support among business leaders and Wall Street, who certainly haven\u2019t lack for economic benefits in today\u2019s world. They aren\u2019t supporting him with their money, but many of them detest Clinton and see Trump as expressing their world view. For Wall Street, that makes some sense, in that in the wake of the financial crisis, key aspects of finance are becoming less popular and less profitable. In that sense, finance, which was the winning sector of the economy from the mid-1980s through the mid-2000s, has been losing ground. The idea of gain and loss, and that every trade represents a winner and a loser, is deeply embedded in aspects of Wall Street.\n\nWe have, of course, no idea which candidate and which worldview will prevail in six weeks. But if Trump wins, he should remember: it is impossible to find any society and any point in American history where a zero-sum formula has led to increased affluence for the many and increased security. Zero-sum most often begets zero-sum, whether in the form of trade wars or actual wars. By contrast, the profound strength of the United States has been a vision of an open economy that thrives on education and innovation and an open world where the strength invariably overcomes the zero-sum countries and alliances that pepper the planet and always have. A vision of winners and losers invariably begets more winners and losers, and little else.\n\nZachary Karabell is head of global strategy at Envestnet and author of The Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World.

	"text": "CLEVELAND \u2014 Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling.\n\nIt was just another day in Trump\u2019s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities \"are absolutely in the worst shape that they\u2019ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King \u2014 who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a \u201cgladiator.\u201d King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered.\n\n\u201cThe system is the problem, and he\u2019s the only gladiator that will take on the system,\u201d King said.\n\nAfter the church event, Trump sat for a \u201ctown hall\u201d with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address \u201cviolence in the black community,\u201d Trump embraced stop-and-frisk.\n\n\u201cWe did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nBut even before Trump\u2019s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his \u201cever, ever, ever\u201d remark Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,\u201d Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. \u201cIs he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination \u2014 when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal \u2014 in the low single digits \u2014 and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks \u2014 \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d he says \u2014 to largely white audiences.\n\nAt the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd.\n\nSeated to Trump\u2019s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (\u201cthere\u2019s only one,\u201d Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (\u201ctough\u201d), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (\u201ca tough general\u201d) and former \"Apprentice\" star Omarosa Manigault (\u201ca wonderful woman\u201d), who has helped with Trump\u2019s black outreach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,\u201d Trump said from the pulpit.\n\nTrump, who has called himself the \u201claw and order\u201d candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been \u201cchoking\u201d in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents.\n\n\"Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?\u201d\n\nKing, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference.\n\nKing, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that \u201cthe system\u201d had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely.\n\n\u201cEvery white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,\u201d said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans.\n\n\u201cI told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro \u2014 I would use the N-word \u2014 but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,\u201d King said.\n\nWhen Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, \u201cAh, there\u2019s only one Don King.\u201d\n\nBefore King, Cohen, Trump\u2019s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the \u201cdisgusting, liberal, mainstream media\u201d and its casting of Trump as a \u201cracist.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe word of the 2016 election has somehow become \u2018racist,\u2019\u201d Cohen complained. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let\u2019s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d\n\nCohen said, \u201cNot only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cThey come and they take your vote,\u201d Trump said, \u201cand they say they\u2019ll see you in four years.\u201d\n\n\n\nAuthors:"

We have to respect our flag.\n\n\u201cWe all have to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country.\n\n\u201cMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world\u2019s leader. How can we lead when we can\u2019t even control our own cities?\n\n\u201cWe honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.\n\n\u201cEvery single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end.\n\n\u201cThe people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It\u2019s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that.\n\n\u201cThere is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration.\n\n\u201cOur job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.\u201d\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com"

	"text": "The pressure is on Hillary Clinton.\n\nInsiders in both parties agree: Clinton, having lost most of her lead over the past few weeks and bringing more experience to the stage, faces higher expectations than Donald Trump when the two square off for the first debate on Long Island.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThat\u2019s according to The POLITICO Caucus \u2014 a panel of activists, strategists and operatives in 11 key battleground states. Roughly equal percentages of Democrats (69 percent) and Republicans (74 percent) said Clinton is under more pressure to perform than Trump. But Democrats mostly lamented the low expectations for Trump, a relative political neophyte who has exhibited little command of the issues.\n\n\u201cShe shouldn't be [under more pressure], but so long as he avoids standing on stage and vomiting on himself, the press will give Trump a glowing review,\u201d said a Nevada Democrat \u2014 who, like all respondents, completed the survey anonymously. \u201cHillary will need a strong performance to demonstrate that she passes and Trump fails the commander-in-chief test.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe media and Trump himself have set the bar too low for Trump,\u201d a New Hampshire Democrat added. \u201cPresidents don't get graded on a curve, and candidates in debates shouldn't be either.\u201d\n\nOne Ohio Democrat detected a double standard for the first female major-party nominee.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has spent a public lifetime of being held to a strikingly different standard, and this debate will be no exception,\u201d said the Ohio Democrat. \u201cShe will have to answer every single question flawlessly, exude gravitas, look presidential, channel Bill's and Barack's oratorical mastery, not raise her voice, not cough, wear an acceptable pantsuit, smile enough, be likable, not laugh and have a good hair day. Donald Trump will just have to show up.\u201d\n\nRepublicans also said Clinton was under greater scrutiny on Monday night, but for different reasons: tightening polls that show Trump eclipsing Clinton in some battleground states.\n\n\u201cSomehow she needs to reverse the trend,\u201d said an Ohio Republican. \u201cNever seen anyone do it before. This will be her chance \u2014 and maybe her last chance.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has to stop [Trump\u2019s] momentum with a strong debate performance, and she has to be able to stand on the stage for 90 minutes and look healthy for 90 minutes or the whole issue of her health comes back with a vengeance,\u201d added a Virginia Republican. \u201cAll [Trump] has to do is not say anything racist or sexist and look like he could be president.\u201d\n\nAmong those insiders who said Trump was under more pressure \u2014 31 percent of Democrats and 26 percent of Republicans \u2014 most pointed to the GOP nominee\u2019s volatile personality.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton is expected to do well. She is a policy wonk,\u201d said a Michigan Republican. \u201cThe pressure is on Donald Trump not to lose his cool. He has been doing very well in his public appearances, but that is with the assistance of a TelePrompTer. He will have no such help at the debate, and if I were coaching Hillary Clinton, I would be encouraging her to get him as riled up as possible. To win the debate, all Trump really needs to do is meet expectations, keep his cool, and look presidential.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question we are all waiting to have answered is: Can he be serious?\u201d added a Michigan Democrat. \u201cCan he answer questions directly? How will he react (or overreact) when he is directly challenged? Can he control his temper?\u201d\n\nTwo other takeaways from the pre-debate survey:\n\nMost insiders expect Clinton to \u201cwin\u201d the debate.\n\nMajorities in both parties peg Clinton as most likely to be the victor on Monday night: 76 percent of Democrats and 59 percent of Republicans.\n\n\u201cMedia look at who best answered questions, and that will likely be Hillary,\u201d said an Iowa Republican.\n\n\u201c[Clinton\u2019s] mastery of issues and policies and no-nonsense delivery will prevail over bluster, name-calling and promises that can never be kept,\u201d added a New Hampshire Democrat.\n\nBut not all Democrats were so optimistic about Clinton \u2014 or the media through which voters will interpret the debate.\n\n\u201cThe press wants Trump to win,\u201d said a Florida Democrat. \u201cTheir disdain for her, plus desire to keep the race alive, means unless he really screws up, they'll give him the win on the most absurd grade curve ever.\u201d\n\nSome Republicans also claimed media bias \u2014 in the other direction.\n\n\u201cThe media has never been more in the tank for a candidate in modern history: CNN, NBC, ABC and POLITICO will all say she won,\u201d a Virginia Republican said. \u201cBut then again everyone also 'knew' that Carter beat Reagan in their debate as well.\u201d\n\nInsiders think the debate will matter.\n\nAsked whether they expect the debate to have a significant impact on the race, most insiders in both parties think it will generate momentum for one of the candidates.\n\nAmong Democratic insiders, 66 percent believe Clinton will benefit from the debate, 11 percent think Trump will get a bounce and 23 percent don\u2019t expect the debate to move the needle.\n\n\u201cTrump will flounder, ramble and lie (because he always does),\u201d a Michigan Democrat predicted. \u201cThe moderators will challenge him, and he'll get mad. He'll complain afterwards that they picked on him and favored Hillary. First impressions are hard to shake off, and this won't go well for him.\u201d\n\nThe numbers were flipped for Republicans, with slightly less enthusiasm for the GOP standard-bearer: 52 percent think the debate will help Trump, 26 percent think it will help Clinton and 22 percent said it wouldn\u2019t have a significant impact.\n\n\u201cTrump has the most to gain by appearing presidential and even-tempered,\u201d said a New Hampshire Republican. \u201cHe does that successfully, and he cuts into Hillary's greatest strength.\u201d\n\nBut some Republicans said Clinton could stunt Trump\u2019s momentum with a strong performance Monday night.\n\n\u201cIf she pins his ears back, [it helps her],\u201d said an Iowa Republican. \u201cIf it's a draw, it's a net negative for her. She has to have something to stop his momentum. She's got to hit him with a brick.\u201d\n\nOther insiders, however, doubted whether the debate would have a significant, permanent effect on the race.\n\n\u201cWe're past the era of the big debate swings: the bloodless Dukakis death penalty answer, the Reagan age quip, the Bentsen 'you're no John Kennedy' moments,\u201d an Iowa Republican said. \u201cSwing voters are like the California Condor, a critically endangered species disappearing at an alarming rate. Opinion media, partisan polarization, and two highly unpopular candidates make this a battle over a very small group of voters in about a dozen states, and whatever bounce comes out of this debate will dissipate as quickly as it appears.\u201d\n\nAdded a Florida Democrat: \u201cDoes a damn thing matter this year? I think not.\u201d\n\nThese are the members of The POLITICO Caucus, not all of whom participated in this special survey:\n\nColorado: Ryan Call, Laura Carno, Matt Chandler, Will Coyne, Adam Eichberg, Mark Ferrandino, Cole Finegan, Michael Fortney, Andrew Freedman, Ted Harvey, Craig Hughes, Owen Loftus, Pete Maysmith, Frank McNulty, Karen Middleton, Christopher Murray, BJ Nikkel, Josh Penry, Rick Ridder, Alan Salazar, Janice Sinden, Pat Steadman, Pat Waak, Steve Welchert, Taylor West, Roxane White, Rob Witwer\n\nFlorida: Fernand Amandi, Scott Arceneaux, JP Austin, Tim Baker, Dennis K.

	"text": "Obama To UN: \u2018Giving Up Liberty, Enhances Security In America\u2026\u2019 [VIDEO]\n\nFreedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure \u2014 they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can\u2019t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it\u2019s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty\u2026 you know, for \u201csafety\u201d.\n\nTuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. \u201cWe can only realize the promise of this institution\u2019s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.\u201d\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nSo evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn\u2019t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. \u201cUltimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer \u2014 it\u2019s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.\n\nHow allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it\u2019s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn\u2019t make us safer, either. It\u2019s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right? Obama has an agenda to push."

	"text": "President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the \u2018Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act\u2019 (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,\u201d Obama notes in the veto message.\n\n\u201cI have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.\u201d\n\nThe veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override.\n\nSuffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted.\n\nThe last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nIf passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages.\n\nObama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of \u201csovereign immunity,\u201d and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries.\n\n\"Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today.\n\n\"Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world.\"\n\nBut the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists.\n\nThe House and Senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. A veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the White House says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough Democrats to block the override effort.\n\nObama's former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election."

	"text": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs.\n\nThe two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers.\n\nHere are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:\n\n1. Nominees Started Off on a Friendly Note but No Escaping the Sarcasm\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface.\n\nWhen Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents\u2019 trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, \u201cHow are you, Donald?\u201d Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting.\n\nShortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, \u201cBut in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,\u201d before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, \u201cYes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to be referring to his addressing her as \u201cSecretary Clinton,\u201d although it wasn\u2019t completely clear during the moment.\n\n2. Personal Attacks Came Early\n\nClinton was first to go on the attack during tonight\u2019s debate, taking aim at Trump\u2019s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business.\n\n\u201cDonald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,\u201d Clinton said, before expanding on her father\u2019s work as a drapery maker.\n\nTrump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in \u201ctrumped up, trickle-down\u201d economics.\n\n\u201cFor one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,\u201d Trump said.\n\n3. Trading Barbs Over Trade\n\nVoters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nTrump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim.\n\n\u201cAnd now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nClinton fired back, \u201cWell, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.\u201d\n\nTrump then pointed to Clinton\u2019s once referring to TPP as the \u201cgold standard of trade deals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, \"TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\u201d Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that \u201cwhat I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.\u201d\n\n4. Trump Asks \u2018Why Not\u2019 Blame All the World\u2019s Problems on Clinton\n\nLess than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: \"I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.\u201d\n\nTrump didn\u2019t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\nClinton responded: \"Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this\u2014\u201c\n\nTrump interjected: \"There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,\u201d before the moderator reminded Trump, \"This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.\"\n\nDrew Angerer/Getty Images\n\n5. Trump Hit Over Not Releasing Tax Returns\n\nTrump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns.\n\n\u201cI don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,\u201d he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general.\n\nTrump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. \u201cI will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,\u201d she said. \u201cYou got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns?\n\n\u201cMaybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,\u201d she said.\n\n6. The Birther Issue Gets on the Main Stage\n\nModerator Lester Holt asked Trump \u201cwhat took you so long\u201d to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee\u2019s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years.\n\nAt first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was \u201csatisfied\u201d with when Obama released his birth certificate.\n\nHolt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it\u2019s authenticity until 2015.\n\n\u201cNobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,\u201d Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump\u2019s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. \u201cI figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.\u201d\n\nPaul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images\n\n7. Clinton Defends Being \u2018Prepared\u2019 When Trump Questions Her Time Off the Trail\n\nTrump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, \u201cI\u2019ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,\u201d seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight\u2019s faceoff.\n\n\"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,\u201d Clinton said. \"And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.\u201d\n\nThroughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.\n\n8. Stop and Frisk Becomes a Big Point of Discussion\n\nTrump\u2019s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate.\n\n\u201cStop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that \u201cit went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would have won an appeal,\u201d he said, noting that there was no appeal.\n\nTrump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.\n\n9. Trump and the Iraq War Under the Microscope\n\nToward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started.\n\n\u201cI did not support the war in Iraq,\u201d Trump said. \"That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.\u201d\n\nHolt corrected him, saying, \u201cThe record shows otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, \u201cAre you for invading Iraq?\"\n\nTrump appeared to hesitate, responding, \u201cYeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.\u201d\n\nDespite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, \u201cThe record shows that I am right.\u201d\n\n10. Sparring Over Stamina\n\nHolt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a \u201cpresidential look,\u201d asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her \u201cstamina.\u201d\n\n\"She doesn't have the look, she doesn\u2019t have the stamina,\u201d Trump said. \"I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.\u201d\n\nTrump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down.\n\n\"Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nShe also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women:\n\n\"One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,\u201d Clinton said. \"But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.\u201d"

	"text": "\"Donald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward,\" Ted Cruz said in March. | Getty 9 times Ted Cruz insulted Donald Trump before endorsing him\n\nTwo months after he was booed off the stage at the Republican National Convention for snubbing his party\u2019s presidential nominee, Sen. Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump on Friday.\n\nThat declaration to vote for him, though, comes after the Texas senator openly disparaged his primary opponent repeatedly \u2014 in part responding to Trump\u2019s attacks on his wife and father.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n1. Early on, Cruz speculated that Trump\u2019s tax returns could show a mob connection\n\nIn February, Cruz offered his take on why Trump hadn\u2019t released his tax returns in an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d suggesting that they might show \u201cDonald's business dealings with the mob, with the mafia.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that Donald seems terrified to release his taxes suggests that there\u2019s a bombshell there,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt\u2019s natural to wonder, \u2018Well, what is it that he's hiding in his taxes?\u2019\u201d\n\n2. In March, Cruz called him a \u201csniveling coward\u201d\n\nSpeaking to a group of reporters in Dane, Wisconsin, after Trump made a comment promising to \u201cspill the beans\u201d on the senator\u2019s wife, Cruz pointed his finger and said, \u201cDonald, you\u2019re a sniveling coward. Leave Heidi the hell alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to tick me off. I don\u2019t get angry often, but you mess with my wife, you mess with my kids, that\u2019ll do it every time,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n3. He also called Trump a \u201cbig, loud New York bully\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be absolutely clear: Our spouses and our children are off bounds,\u201d Cruz said . \u201cIt is not acceptable for a big, loud New York bully to attack my wife.\u201d\n\n4. Also, \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks, Cruz suggested , were actions of \u201ca small and petty man who is intimidated by strong women.\u201d\n\n5. Cruz called one of Trump\u2019s theories \u201cnuts\u201d and \u201cjust kooky\u201d\n\nIn May, after Trump cited a National Enquirer report that alleged Cruz\u2019s father may have had some involvement in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Cruz addressed reporters in Evansville, Indiana: \u201cThis morning, Donald Trump went on national television and attacked my father. Donald Trump alleges that my dad was involved in assassinating JFK. Now, let\u2019s be clear, this is nuts. This is not a reasonable position. This is just kooky.\u201d\n\n6. He also called him a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who \u201clies practically every word that comes out of his mouth\u201d\n\nAlso in Indiana, on the same day the state's voters would deliver a decisive victory to Trump, Cruz added : \u201cI\u2019m gonna tell you what I really think of Donald Trump: This man is a pathological liar. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth, and in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.\u201d\n\n7. And Cruz was specific with the term \u201cpathological\u201d: Trump is \u201cutterly amoral,\u201d he said\n\n\u201cI say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory and he\u2019d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he\u2019s telling, at that minute he believes it, but the man is utterly amoral,\u201d Cruz said .\n\n8. And, while he was at it, Cruz accused him of narcissism and being a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d\n\nContinuing to unload in Indiana, Cruz offered : \u201cHe combines [dishonesty] with being a narcissist, a narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country\u2019s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and says, \u2018Dude, what\u2019s your problem?\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\nAnd: \u201cDonald Trump is a serial philanderer, and he boasts about it. This is not a secret. He\u2019s proud of being a serial philanderer.\u201d\n\n9. In July, Cruz still hadn\u2019t forgiven Trump for the attacks on his family\n\n\u201cI am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,\u201d Cruz said, answering questions at a Texas delegation breakfast at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and facing backlash for not yet endorsing Trump.\n\nReferring to his pledge to support his party\u2019s nominee, Cruz said that statement \u201cwas not a blanket commitment that if you slander and attack Heidi I'm going to nonetheless go like a servile puppy dog\" and support him.\n\nAuthors:"

That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are.\n\nRadicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind\u2026 racism and violence are not of God.\n\nFrom the Independent Review Journal:\n\nBut after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people \u201ctaking a knee\u201d began to circulate on social media. These people weren\u2019t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer. The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: \u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now \u201cNorth Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.\u201d And the troopers weren\u2019t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:\n\nPeople in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn\u2019t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not.\n\nI was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham\u2019s ministry there\u2026 they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I\u2019m so very proud of these police officers\u2026 they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group\u2026 they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith."

And I never felt this way until now and I can\u2019t stand how we\u2019re treated,\u201d the grade-school girl said, wiping away tears.\n\nDavid T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo\n\nShe expressed the hardship that children face when a parent dies. Scott himself, who was African-American, had seven children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that we have to go to their graveyard and bury them. And we have tears. We shouldn\u2019t have tears. We need our fathers and mothers to be by our side,\u201d she said.\n\nZianna, as well as the protesters in the room who chanted \"no justice, no peace\" after she spoke, helped to underscore the degree to which communal wounds have been slow to heal in North Carolina\u2019s most populous city since the shooting.\n\nProtests started on the streets of Charlotte after news of Scott's shooting broke last Tuesday and, occasionally, became violent as they continued deeper into the week.\n\nDavid T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo\n\nThe scene grew especially tense Wednesday night when police clad in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at demonstrators. Some people in the crowds threw bottles and rocks at officers and passing cars, blocked an interstate highway, surrounded and jumped on vehicles, looted businesses and stormed the entrance of a Hyatt hotel, injuring two of its employees.\n\nAt the city council meeting, Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts called for decorum at several points during public remarks. At several points, protesters yelled criticism of her and Police Chief Kerr Putney.\n\nAfter the meeting wrapped up, The Charlotte Observer reported, more than 20 protesters moved to the lobby of the Government Center.\n\n\u201cRelease. Release. The whole damn tape,\u201d the protesters chanted, according to the newspaper.\n\nDavid T. Foster III/The Charlotte Observer via AP Photo\n\nRay Dotch, Scott's brother-in-law, Monday called for the release of the entire video of his shooting in an interview with ABC News.\n\nChief Putney has released body and dashboard camera videos of the fatal police shooting of Scott, answering to demands made by community leaders, protesters and politicians. But it is not entirely clear from those videos or from the one taken by Scott's wife, Rakeiya Scott, that the victim had a gun on his person, as the police allege. It is also not entirely clear that he brandished it in such a way that would have posed a threat to the officers who approached him."

	"text": "I\u2019ve watched every presidential debate ever broadcast, including the little-remembered John F. Kennedy-Hubert Humphrey contest just before the 1960 West Virginia primary, and for nearly 40 years I've analyzed how candidates win and lose them. But when I ask myself what kind of strategy I would devise for Hillary Clinton tonight against Donald Trump, I\u2019m pretty much baffled.\n\nThe problem is not just the unpredictable (to put it mildly) nature of her opponent. (Will Trump be low-key and calm? Will he attack her honesty? Will he turn on Lester Holt after the first tough question and walk off the stage?) The problem is that almost all of Hillary Clinton\u2019s strengths, in this strange election year, can so easily be turned into her weaknesses\u2014especially her vast experience in government. The more she emphasizes her qualifications, the more Trump is likely to respond with some version of: \u201cYou\u2019ve been at the center of power for 25 years? Then you\u2019re one of those who\u2019s created the mess we\u2019re in.\u201d So reciting her work with foreign leaders, for example, and contrasting it with Trump's utter lack of grounding in the world, doesn't seem to be promising.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIndeed, this debate offers Trump the chance to perform what I\u2019ve called \u201cpolitical judo\u201d\u2014turning an opponent\u2019s strength against her. (\u201cYes, Mrs. Clinton, your experience helped drag us into Iraq, and turned Syria, Libya, the whole Middle East into a staging ground for ISIS. Maybe that\u2019s why your husband's CIA director, and Bobby Kennedy\u2019s chief speechwriter, are backing me.\u201d)\n\nFurther, there's a sense\u2014a highly limited sense\u2014in which Trump is in something like the position Ronald Reagan was in back in 1980. Among college-educated whites, who have resisted him so far, his task is to use the debates to say, \u201cI'm a reasonable person who knows what's gone wrong and who has the instincts to fix it.\u201d It's a second cousin of the 1980 situation where many voters did not want Carter, but needed reassurance about Reagan, which they got. (There is a limit to this analogy, because for all of her difficulties, Clinton is in a much stronger position than President Carter was).\n\nBy contrast, how does she try to gain strength on the issue of \u201chonest and trustworthy\u201d? If Trump can be convinced by his handlers\u2014assuming they exist\u2014to avoid overkill here, all he has to do is to note what the FBI director or the New York Times editorial page has said. She can of course cite chapter and verse on Trump\u2014bankruptcies, Trump University, David Farenthold's expose of his charities in the Washington Post\u2014but those issues are ill-suited, I think, to a face-to-face debate. One of her problems, longstanding, is that the stuff of which campaign collapses are made have been leveled at Trump\u2014and he's still standing.\n\nDoes any of this mean that Clinton is facing doom Monday night? No. It does suggest that her campaign should remember what debates do and don\u2019t do, based on a half-century or so of history.\n\nThe Focus Is on \u201cMoments\u201d\u2014But They\u2019re Not Always The Key\n\nAsk any political journalist to recite the history of debates, and it would go something like this:\n\n\u201cNixon looked pale and drawn; Ford prematurely liberated Poland from Soviet Control; Reagan said to Carter \u2018there you go again,\u2019 then asked Americans \u2018are you better off?\u2019 Four years later, he was incoherent, but then recovered by joking about Mondale\u2019s \u2018youth and inexperience.\u2019 Dukakis was insufficiently emotional at the prospect of his wife\u2019s rape and murder. Lloyd Bentsen told Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy. George H.W. Bush looked at his watch. Al Gore stalked George W. Bush, who froze him with a nod.\u201d\n\nThese are the moments that are played over and over again in the run-up to debates. They illustrate the fact that these events are watched intensely for the quip, the gaffe, the thrust, the parry that can sum up 90 minutes. It\u2019s why debate prep spends an inordinate amount of time trying to come up with punchy, memorable lines\u2014\u201czingers\u201d\u2014to win the attention and admiration of the audience. (It\u2019s also why the late political journalist Lars Erik-Nelson scornfully said of his colleagues, \u201cYou\u2019ve all become theater critics.\u201d)\n\nBut in fact, this view of debates is not the whole story. Sometimes, it\u2019s the cumulative effect of the exchanges that can determine who prevails. Look back at the first Romney-Obama debate in 2012. There was no one exchange, no one Obama stumble or Romney answer, that provided the \u201daha!\u201d moment that journalists wait for the way hounds wait for the first call of the fox. It was, rather, Obama\u2019s petulant, defensive, sometimes indifferent answers that made even the president\u2019s most ardent supporters believe he had been badly beaten.\n\nThe presence of Trump clearly raises the odds that we may see a \u201cmoment\u201d unlike any in debate history; that\u2019s clearly what an army of reporters and tens of millions of viewers will be waiting for. But it may just be that it will be the totality of the hour and a half that will persuade a viewer to say: \u201che seemed pretty reasonable\u201d or \u201cshe knows what she\u2019s talking about and he doesn\u2019t.\u201d This has special relevance for Clinton, who, as her longtime friend and one-time aide Patti Solis-Doyle observed, always seems as if she is testing every word before it leaves her mouth. A sustained, relaxed presentation over the course of the debate could be her best weapon against a Trump, whose ability to stay within himself when untethered to a Teleprompter is questionable.\n\nThere Are Three Debates, Not One\u2014And That Can Matter A Whole Lot\n\nOne key reason why the 1980 Reagan-Carter debate was so important is that it was the only debate between the two. Carter had refused to debate with third-party candidate John Anderson, so Reagan faced off against Anderson on September 21st. When the independent fell below the polling threshold, Carter and Reagan met for the first and last time on October 28th\u2014barely a week before the election.\n\nEvery other time, there have been three debates; which has meant there is a chance to make up for a less than successful debut. That\u2019s what happened with Reagan in 1984, and with George W. Bush in 2004; it\u2019s also what happened last time out, when Obama emerged from his daze and outperformed Romney in their two other meetings.\n\nHere, I think, is an opening for Clinton\u2014especially in the town hall meetings, where she should be able to turn a question\u2014and they are usually very lame \"what can you do for my daughter?\" questions\u2014into answers that fuse personal concern with a command both of her proposals, and of Trump\u2019s astonishing inability to remember what he has proposed from one day to the next. The danger for her is channeling her inner Al Gore, who challenged Bush\u2019s commitment to health care by repeatedly demanding: \"What about Dingell-Norwood?\" The opportunity for her is to argue\u2014from experience\u2014that what she has worked for in public life has made the lives of real people better. (Further, the Town Meeting format\u2014with dozens of \u201creal\u201d people as participants\u2014makes the resort to personal insults highly risky).\n\nTrump Is Not the Only One Who Can Deploy Political Judo\n\nThe potential for Trump to turn strength into weakness has its roots in the most singularly successful use of political judo. It came in 1992, when independent Ross Perot was asked if voters should be bothered by his lack of experience.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthey've got a point. I don't have any experience in running up a $4 trillion debt. I don't have any experience in gridlocked government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world.\u201d\n\nJudo, however, can cut both ways. There\u2019s a clear opening for Clinton if Trump were to boast of his leadership skills, and his business success.\n\n\u201cWell, you might be successful, Donald, but we really don\u2019t know because you\u2019re the first presidential candidate ever who won\u2019t show us his taxes. But you know, you should look at the business leaders who support me: Mike Bloomberg, who\u2019s worth four times what you claim to be worth, and who didn\u2019t start with millions from his father, says you\u2019re a con, a fake. So does Marc Cuban, who built his success from the ground up. But I do have to admit\u2014you\u2019re way, way ahead of them in, unpaid workers, fleeced contractors and lawsuits.\u201d\n\nDebates Are NOT Decisive\n\nOne last note. It\u2019s easy to assume that the fate of the world is at stake Monday night. A lot of post-election narratives over the years have located debates as the center of the story (\u201cReagan recovered from his first debate-gaffe and went onto win a landslide.\u201d \u201cObama was far more effective in the later debates and was re-elected\u2026\u201d). But is correlation really causation? Maybe the economic boom of 1984 has a lot more to do with Reagan winning 49 states; maybe the clear if modest economic recovery played the key role in Obama\u2019s clear if modest popular vote victory.\n\nIn their influential 2013 book, The Gamble, political scientists John H.

We can \u2014 you know, we can take it, no matter who wins.\u2019 No. The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years, and I say that absolutely seriously.\u201d\n\nThe former secretary of state said she hopes everyone is registered to vote and directed listeners to a website to find out whether they\u2019re registered \u201cbecause I need you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe gotta stand up and be counted in this election,\u201d she added.\n\nClinton\u2019s comments come after President Barack Obama made an appeal on Clinton's and his own behalf in an address to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation on Saturday.\n\n\u201cMy name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,\u201d Obama said. \u201cTolerance is on the ballot.

One protester is clinging to life by a thread after being critically wounded by a protester who shot into the crowd randomly. He was hit in the head and is on life support.\n\nThree other protesters and four officers were wounded in the chaos. I even heard that protesters tried to throw a reporter into a fire. I also saw white people in their cars with guns for protection. I can\u2019t say that I blame them. The NASCAR Hall of Fame and many other businesses were hit by vandals during all of this. The National Guard has now arrived to help fight the increasing violence in Charlotte.\n\nFrom the Daily Mail:\n\nNational Guard troops have arrived in Charlotte after a protest turned violent on Wednesday night. A state of emergency has been declared in response to the chaos that has taken over the North Carolina city, two days after a father-of-seven was shot dead by a police officer. One of the demonstrators was shot in the head outside the Omni Hotel and is fighting for his life. At least three other protesters and four police officers were also taken to hospital after they were injured in the riot. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV were also attacked while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast. It was the second night of unrest following the deadly shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by black cop, Brentley Vinson, on Tuesday afternoon. Police insist he was armed, but family members maintain he was only reading a book when he was gunned down next to his car. Many businesses and buildings, including the NASCAR Hall of Fame, were hit by vandals and looters. Major companies with offices in the downtown area \u2013 including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Duke Energy \u2013 all told employees to stay away from the area Thursday. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts is considering putting a curfew in place in a bid to control the disorder.\n\nA number of black people defended the police officers, but there were far more that wanted to get their violence on there. A cameraman and reporter for WCNC-TV was attacked, while a CNN correspondent was body-slammed during a live broadcast.\n\nOn Thursday morning, hotel and restaurant employees and security guards started cleaning up dozens of broken windows after protesters smashed buildings and painted the slogan \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 on walls. Demonstrators were also seen breaking into a convenience store and a shop that sells merchandise for the NBA franchise, the Charlotte Hornets. Others set fire to trash cans. Some protesters expressed anger at the lawlessness exhibited by fellow demonstrators. One woman was heard shouting, \u201cStop \u2013 that\u2019s not what this is about,\u201d as young men broke bottles in the street.\n\nAfter a black man shot another protester, demonstrators began throwing bottles, dirt clods and fireworks at the officers. The police fired flash grenades and then tear gas back, dispersing the crowd of several hundred. Protesters responded by hurling trash cans and potted plants.\n\nA riot is an uncontrollable beast\u2026 once you unleash it, it takes on a life of its own and the message is usually lost in the violence and chaos that ensues. I fear this is another step in a race war and all out chaos in our streets. Russia must be smiling.\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com"

Sander Levin called on the IRS Wednesday to audit The Trump Foundation, following a report that the billionaire used charity money to pay off legal settlements.\n\n\"It is important that charitable funds be used for charitable purposes, rather than promote the business ventures of those affiliated with the charity. I therefore request an immediate audit of the Donald J.

The Post reported that Trump used the charity to pay for a $100,000 settlement with the city of Palm Beach in 2007 and used another $158,000 from his charity to settle a lawsuit filed in 2011 about a hole-in-one claim at a charity golf tournament.\n\nThe revelation immediately drew accusations from Democrats of Trump self-dealing.

	"text": "In March, in a bold \u201cOh yeah?\u201d moment during an interview with the Washington Post\u2019s editorial board, Donald Trump took the paper\u2019s dare and revealed, then and there, his very short list of foreign policy advisers. There were just five, though he said, \u201cI have quite a few more.\u201d The list was a head-scratcher, a random assortment of obscure and questionable pundits. One of the names, offered without elaboration, was, \u201cCarter Page, PhD.\u201d\n\nWho?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nReporters quickly Googling found that Page is the founder and managing partner of an investment fund called Global Energy Capital, and that he claims to have years of experience investing in Russia and the energy sector. As for his connection to Trump, when Page was reached for comment by the New York Times the day after Trump\u2019s big reveal, he said he had been sending policy memos to the campaign and the paper said he \u201cwill be advising Mr. Trump on energy policy and Russia.\u201d\n\nThis piqued my interest: I have been a Russia wonk for most of my adult life, I spent years living and reporting from Moscow, still go there regularly for reporting trips, and am in touch with lots of friends there. And yet, despite the tightly knit nature of the expat business community in Russia, no one I spoke to had ever heard of Carter Page.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this guy\u2019s name?\u201d says one former Western energy CEO who spent years in Russia, and would have overlapped there with Page.\n\n\u201cI had not heard of Carter Page before it came out in the media,\u201d says another prominent Western businessman who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades. \u201cBut I am getting a lot of emails from friends asking, \u2018Have you heard of this guy?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cStrangely, I've never heard of Carter Page until this Trump connection,\u201d Bill Browder responded to me in an email. He was one of the biggest Western players in the Russian market until President Vladimir Putin turned on him and Browder became his fierce critic. \u201cIt's odd, because I've heard of every other financier who was a player on Moscow at the time.\u201d\n\nSomeone, apparently, has heard of him: On Friday, Yahoo News reported that Page was being probed by U.S. intelligence for purported back-channel ties to Russian leaders. The story resurfaced the name of a character who\u2019d all but vanished from the campaign, and reawakened questions about who, exactly, Trump was surrounding himself with.\n\nThis has been a concern swirling around the outsider candidate since he began, a real-estate developer with almost no serious Washington connections to tap for advice. \u201cI\u2019m going to surround myself only with the best and most serious people,\" Trump famously told a Post reporter last summer about how he would staff his campaign. \"We want top-of-the-line professionals.\u201d As the primaries unfolded, it became increasingly obvious that Trump would need all the top-of-the-line help he could get when it came to foreign policy. In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump confused the Kurds with the Iranian Al-Quds Force, couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas, and couldn\u2019t recognize the name of the leader of ISIS. (In his defense, Trump said that \u201cHugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere, that would have known those names.\u201d) The Republican foreign policy specialists who would normally be a brain trust began slamming him in the press or publicly signing on to anti-Trump manifestos. And since they increasingly were fleeing the candidate, who were the people who would line up to advise him instead? What would they be like?\n\nEnter Carter Page, a 44-year-old Ph.D., and business school graduate who claims an expertise in Russia and energy, yet who, I quickly discovered, was known by neither Russia experts nor energy experts nor Russian energy experts. (\u201cI can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they\u2019ll say, \u2018Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?\u2019\u201d says one veteran Western investor in Russian energy.) Page also, as I would be surprised to discover, appears largely unknown to Trump\u2019s own campaign.\n\nWhat I did find, however, is that while Page might not be helping Trump, Trump has been a significant help to Page. Since being named by Trump as an adviser, Page, who has spent his career trying to put together energy deals in Russia and the former Soviet Union, has finally begun to be noticed in the region. He is being treated in Russia as a person with potentially important ties in America. \u201cHe\u2019s an extremely well-informed, authoritative expert on Russia,\u201d says Mikhail Leontiev, a pro-Kremlin talking head and spokesman for Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil giant. \u201cPeople really respect him in this industry. He\u2019s a very serious guy, and he has a good reputation.\u201d According to the Yahoo report, U.S. intelligence believes Page had an audience with top Russian officials\u2014including Rosneft head Igor Sechin\u2014during a summer trip to Moscow. From what I could find about him, it\u2019s hard to imagine he could have secured those meetings without that mention by Trump.\n\nPage has also been the subject of some breathless coverage in the American press. A March Bloomberg profile touted his \u201cdeep ties\u201d with \u201cexecutives at Gazprom,\u201d the state-owned Russian gas giant, whom he says he advised on some of its biggest deals of the past decade. Last month, the Post ran a piece that was breathless in a different way, casting him as a shadowy broker with potentially important ties in Russia, some of them unsavory. The Yahoo story also portrays Page as a well-connected, high-rolling businessman with \u201cextensive business interests in Russia\u201d and an office \u201caround the corner from Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nPage has fueled all this by making some remarkable statements, including saying Putin is a better leader than President Barack Obama to a June closed-door meeting of foreign policy Brahmins in Washington. In July, in Moscow, he spoke at the New Economic School\u2019s commencement ceremony, a university that had hosted Obama just seven years ago. Page used the speech to slam the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of American foreign policy in front of a Russian audience, saying, \u201cWashington and other Western powers have impeded potential progress through their often hypocritical focus on ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime change.\u201d He is now frequently quoted on Russian television, which hails him as a \u201cfamous American economist\u201d and \u201cadviser to Donald Trump on questions of foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAll of which reveals something deeply strange about Trump: when he shoots from the hip, his remarks do more than just whip up Twitter controversies. They also occasionally and unintentionally mint a new species of \u201cinsiders,\u201d people who seem to be in Trump\u2019s orbit but who may not have\u2014and may never have had\u2014any access to the gilded inner sanctum at all.\n\nBut someone is paying attention. As I started looking into Page, I began getting calls from two separate \u201ccorporate investigators\u201d digging into what they claim are all kinds of shady connections Page has to all kinds of shady Russians. One is working on behalf of various unnamed Democratic donors; the other won\u2019t say who turned him on to Page\u2019s scent. Both claimed to me that the FBI was investigating Page for allegedly meeting with Igor Sechin and Sergei Ivanov, who was until recently Putin\u2019s chief of staff\u2014both of whom are on the sanctions list\u2014when Page was in Moscow in July for that speech.\n\nSo the question continued to linger: Who is Carter Page?\n\n***\n\nI should tell you before we get any further that Page wouldn\u2019t talk to me for this story. I called his fund and left messages, both on the general line and his personal voice mail. I emailed him repeatedly. I asked the Trump campaign to put me in touch. I emailed the Bloomberg journalist who interviewed him, who passed the request on. I even called Carter Page\u2019s father in Poughkeepsie, New York, who told me he would ask his son to talk to me. But alas, no dice.\n\nThis was disappointing: No one who worked in Moscow when Page was there seemed to know who he was, and I just wanted to talk to someone who did. At a certain point, I just needed confirmation that he even existed.\n\nOK, I thought. Try a different route. Maybe all these prominent Western businessmen who worked in Russia for decades didn\u2019t know Page, but maybe it was because some of them worked in different spheres of the Russian economy. He did, after all, have such an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nPage\u2019s biography on the website of his energy fund, Global Energy Capital, hits all the right notes. It was, at first glance, the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of an up-and-coming player in the opaque but lucrative Russian energy market. \u201cHe spent 7 years as an investment banker at Merrill Lynch in London, Moscow and New York where he most recently served as Chief Operating Officer of the Energy and Power Group,\u201d his bio reads. \u201cHe was involved in over $25 billion of transactions in the energy and power sector. He spent 3 years in Moscow where he was responsible for the opening of the Merrill office and was an advisor on key transactions for Gazprom, RAO UES and others.\u201d\n\nThose were some of the biggest energy deals of the 2000s, and Page\u2019s tenure in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office, from 2004 to 2007, would have put him in the right place at the right time. He says he was part of the carving up of RAO UES, a massive Russian electric power holding company. He told Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom when it bought a stake in the Sakhalin II oil and gas project. Those were huge, huge things. If he were deeply involved, he would definitely count as a player. And surely he left at least a trace in the records of those deals.\n\nSo I called Ian Craig, the CEO of Sakhalin Energy from 2004 to 2009, who was doing the negotiations with Gazprom and stayed on as CEO after the deal went through. (It wasn\u2019t really a deal, to be clear: Sakhalin II was a large project in the Far East, and Gazprom essentially elbowed its way into the project when the government forced the consortium to sell the gas giant a controlling stake.) But Craig said he didn\u2019t know anyone named Carter Page. He was also surprised to hear about Merrill Lynch\u2019s purported involvement in the deal. \u201cI don\u2019t think Merrill Lynch or anyone else was front-lining the negotiations, because it was all done at the highest level, because it was very political,\u201d says Craig . \u201cIt closed at CEO level, and eventually Putin himself signed off on it.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked a prominent Western businessman, who has worked in the former Soviet Union for over two decades and who is said to socialize with Sechin and other members of the Russian elite, about Page\u2019s claim to Bloomberg that he advised Gazprom on Sakhalin II, he said, \u201cI rolled my eyes at that one.\u201d (He, too, said he hadn\u2019t heard of Page until Trump\u2019s announcement.)\n\nFine. OK. Maybe Page exaggerated a bit on that one. But what about the reorganization and privatization of RAO UES, the Russian electricity giant? Maybe some of the Russians he worked with remembered a Carter Page?\n\nTurns out, they did.\n\n\u201cHis nickname was stranichkin,\u201d from the Russian word stranichka, or \u201clittle page,\u201d says Artem Torchinsky, who met Page during the breakup of RAO UES. Torchinsky, who was part of the company\u2019s financial department, worked alongside Page, who, at the time worked in Merrill Lynch\u2019s Moscow office. It was 2007, and Merrill Lynch was underwriting the sale of one part of RAO UES, and Torchinsky was resentful of Page and the other Merrill Lynchers: Torchinsky and the in-house team did all the work, and Page and his team would swoop in to give the presentation. They were the fancy Western window dressing. \u201cIt really irritated our team,\u201d Torchinsky told me over Skype. \u201cWe worked around the clock, and then they would come in and say something incomprehensible and we\u2019d have to correct them. These guys didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.\u201d As for Page, \u201cHe made no impression whatsoever. Whether he was there or not, it made no difference,\u201d Torchinsky says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a pro, you see it. Page, unfortunately, did not leave that impression.\u201d\n\nOK, harsh. But then I talked to Page\u2019s former boss, former Russian Central Bank Chairman Sergei Aleksashenko, who ran the Moscow office of Merrill Lynch for part of the time Page worked there. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t great and he wasn\u2019t terrible,\u201d Aleksashenko says, exasperated and confused by the interest of all these journalists pestering him for information about someone \u201cwithout any special talents or accomplishments,\u201d someone who was \u201ca gray spot.\u201d \u201cWhat can you say about a person who in no way [is] exceptional?\u201d he asked me.\n\nPage was a vice president at Merrill Lynch in Moscow, which sounds senior but is a common title in the finance world; a big firm like Merrill Lynch might have thousands of VPs. In the Moscow office, there were five ranks, and VP was right in the middle. In effect, it was \u201cjust the oldest of the youngest, three from the bottom,\u201d says Aleksashenko.\n\nWhen it came to finance, Aleksashenko says, Page \u201cwas not a specialist in any branches of finance or in any instruments.\u201d When it came to energy, Page and his team were, according to Torchinsky, \u201cmildly speaking, not competent in the field of energy.\u201d And, says Aleksashenko, \u201cjudging by the drivel he spews on Russia, you can tell he doesn\u2019t really understand the topic.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s putative adviser on Russia and energy and foreign policy, in other words, \u201cdid not create the impression of someone who was intellectual or well-educated, or someone who was in any way interested or knowledgeable in foreign policy,\u201d says Aleksashenko.\n\n***\n\nFor the past few years, Page has styled himself a foreign policy expert. He has written columns in Global Policy Journal, a new peer-reviewed journal run out of Durham University. They are confoundingly written and make logically curious leaps. \u201cIn recent months, renewed calls for equal justice have brought social tension across the United States after the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police officers in Missouri and New York respectively,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAlthough commonly overlooked, the impact of other fatal mistakes by government officials in the foreign policy arena might vastly outweigh these tragic deaths in potentially catastrophic proportions.\u201d He is the kind of thinker who writes that Kanye West\u2019s \u201cNew Slaves\u201d and the \u201cartist\u2019s creative work offers valuable ideas that could fundamentally improve the direction of U.S. foreign policy and world affairs\u201d but does it by opening with a citation from the Oxford English Dictionary (\u201cSlave; Pronunciation: /sl\u0101v/\u2026\u201d), roping in Adam Sandler, William F. Buckley and Dick Cheney.\n\nHis speech in Moscow\u2019s New Economic School was a similar construction of empty spaces held together with repetition, tautologies, and abuses of the word \u201cironically.\u201d \u201cFor the last 15 years, I\u2019ve been researching, teaching, and writing about fundamental trends in the world economy, which have really continued to evolve in this period and in the years immediately preceding it,\u201d he began. The video of the speech also suggests that after three years living there and a lifetime studying the place, he couldn\u2019t really speak Russian\u2014he had to have his questions translated for him into English. Except to quote, haltingly, brokenly, Vladimir Putin: \u201cWe never meddle in the internal political affairs of other countries. Unlike the USA.\u201d Which is troubling for two reasons: that the adviser of a presidential candidate of a major party is criticizing America abroad by citing Putin, and that the comment implied that he seemed to not know anything about anything going on in, say, Syria or Ukraine.\n\nPage also managed to find his way into a fellowship at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he cut a strange figure. Like other Westerners doing business in Russia, Page took the view that Putin was not the blood-stained and corrupt tyrant some in the West imagine him to be, defending him as a strong leader who brought order and prosperity to Russia. But unlike other entrepreneurial defenders of Putin, people at the Council recall that Page was not particularly good at it. \u201cHe had a guilty-seeming style in making these arguments, making it seem like he didn\u2019t really want to engage,\u201d one person from the Council says. His columns made the rounds and raised eyebrows. \u201cThat blog post about the slaves. That\u2019s just \u2026 strange,\u201d says the Council member.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, but of the people that I know that have Russian foreign policy experience or access and contacts, he wouldn\u2019t be in the last decile, but he\u2019d be in the second-to-last decile,\u201d says one American executive with experience in Russia and its energy sector. \u201cYou\u2019d have to dip really far and wide to find a guy like Carter Page. I mean, wow.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI should\u2019ve just dropped the Carter Page story, but in the months since Trump named him an adviser, the campaign\u2019s Russia connections have become a bigger and bigger issue. Fancy Bear, who was probably a Russian hacker, broke into the Democratic National Committee emails, seemingly handed them over to Julian Assange, who continues to leak the information in a way that is clearly designed to help one campaign and hurt the other. Trump\u2019s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort, flamed out in August because of his shady business dealings with the pro-Kremlin side of Ukraine, and Trump himself continues to say absurd things about Russia and Putin, like publicly inviting the Russian government to continue hacking American servers. Washington was in full Hunt for Red October mode, and it was all I could do to stay on Page\u2019s trail, which began to look more and more like an infinity sign.\n\nI was not the only one. Seemingly everyone I talked to had also talked to the Washington Post, and then there were these corporate investigators who drew a dark and complex web of Page\u2019s connections. Then there was Page, praising Putin. I found myself juggling two mutually contradictory Page narratives: Was Page, like Manafort, followed by a long train of sordid dealings with dark and powerful players with deep pockets and deep resentments toward the West? This was the person described by the corporate investigators trying to whisper into my ear. Was Page a man wheeling and dealing in energy contracts with China and Turkmenistan, who was a vehicle for the Kremlin to influence the American election? Was he a man who, during a three-day trip to Moscow, met with two of Russia\u2019s most powerful men and was now being investigated for it?\n\nBut it was hard to see that man when I actually talked to people who knew him. Page made his way into the financial sector as it ballooned in the early part of the past decade, securing a spot at Merrill Lynch\u2019s London and Moscow offices. Today, he claims he was cozy with Gazprom executives; his former colleagues laugh at the suggestion. \u201cNo one let him into Gazprom,\u201d Aleksashenko says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t go shake [Gazprom chief Alexey] Miller\u2019s hand. He made sure there were cars, hotels and meetings for investors in London.\u201d Another of Page\u2019s colleagues from Merrill Lynch confirmed that Page\u2019s role was simply arranging meetings between Gazprom and Western investors, something normally done by analysts, the lowest rank on the totem pole. \u201cPeople organize meetings with Gazprom all the time,\u201d the former colleague said. \u201cHe hosted these guys in New York City but they would have done this 10 times a year\u2026 I used to do this; it doesn\u2019t require all that much skill. You just send out an email to 20 people saying Gazprom agreed to dinner at this place at 8 p.m., do you want to come? The main thing is just getting those two [Gazprom] guys to agree. But because they agreed doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re close to him.\u201d\n\nBut the meetings did provide him with something else. \u201cGazprom didn\u2019t need money at the time,\u201d says the former colleague. \u201cThey were the most profitable company at the time. Their net profit was something like $36 billion a year. Their problem was not getting investors, but figuring out how to spend money in a non-efficient way if you read between the lines. He was probably aware of that. He would have known how inefficient and wasteful the company is.\u201d Page became an investor in the company, and has, according to filings, advised other companies he\u2019s worked for to invest in them.\n\nAfter Merrill Lynch, Page tried to set up his own fund to invest in energy projects and called it Global Energy Capital. But he tried to do this in 2008, and we know what happened to the markets in 2008. The fund is registered to his father\u2019s address in Poughkeepsie; Page listed himself as \u201cfounder and managing partner,\u201d even though the only other partner seemed to be Sergei Yatsenko, who was once a mid-level executive at Gazprom. He also maintained a website and handed out business cards that listed a fancy Madison Avenue address\u2014that\u2019s the one \u201caround the corner from Trump Tower\u201d\u2014 which was actually the address of a co-working space.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Carter Page,\u201d says an American businessman who has spent nearly a decade working in Russia. \u201cThat\u2019s what he\u2019s been doing, without any actual funding, without any actual experience, without any actual connections or core capabilities, he\u2019s been trying to throw together these deals. He\u2019s always been operating at a level far beneath that at which business in Russia is done. I admire that, it takes a lot of gumption.\u201d\n\nIn the interest of due diligence, I also tried to run down the rumors being handed me by the corporate investigators: that Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank paid for the trip as a favor to the Kremlin; that Page met with Sechin and Ivanov in Moscow; that he is now being investigated by the FBI for those meetings because Sechin and Ivanov were both sanctioned for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know this person,\u201d said Pyotr Aven, one of the two founders of Alfa Bank, which is considered the Western Russian bank. Aven and his partner, Mikhail Fridman, have transferred much of their assets out of Russia and have been quite critical of Putin. As for who paid for Page\u2019s trip, Aven was no less irritated by the question. \u201cI give them money, I don\u2019t know how they spend it, who they invite, when they invite them, I have no idea,\u201d he said of the New Economic School, which hosted Page and of which Aven is the main benefactor. Exasperated by my questions, he snapped, \u201cDon\u2019t bring these Russian-style conspiracy theories to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are engaged in onanism,\u201d said Leontiev, the spokesman for Rosneft and Sechin when I asked him if Page had met with Sechin. \u201cIt\u2019s bullshit. Just bullshit. You need to understand who Sechin is to even ask this question. It\u2019s hard to have a meeting with him at all. It\u2019s absurd.\u201d\n\nAs for the FBI investigation, well, it\u2019s unclear. A State Department official who works on Russia sanctions but was not authorized to speak on the record told me that, for one thing, there is \u201cno prohibition meeting with a designated [sanctioned] individual. Moreover, sanctions violations are not criminal in nature and not enforced by the FBI. OFAC runs them.\u201d He added, \u201cthe story doesn't add up.\u201d What does seem to have happened is that various U.S. intelligence agencies were looking into Page\u2019s time in Moscow, then briefed Senate minority leader, Democrat Harry Reid, who wrote a letter to FBI Director James Comey asking him to investigate, among other things, \u201cwhether a Trump advisor who has been highly critical of U.S. and European economic sanctions on Russia, and who has conflicts of interest due to investments in Russian energy conglomerate Gazprom, met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals while in Moscow in July of 2016, well after Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee.\u201d\n\n***\n\nI got my next surprise when I called Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s senior adviser. I caught him just as the Trump plane was about to take off, and asked him the tired, old question: Who is Carter Page?\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d says Miller, and then went off the record to expound on his lack of involvement in the campaign.\n\n\u201cHe has no formal role in the campaign,\u201d Hope Hicks texted responding to my question.\n\nNow my interest was piqued. There were whispers all over Washington that, despite Hicks\u2019s denial, Page was not only still part of the Trump campaign, but its conduit for Russian influence. Was he?\n\nOne way to answer the question was to figure out how he even got on that list to begin with.\n\nOne source suggested to me that Richard Burt, former U.S. ambassador to Germany, START treaty negotiator, and longtime lobbyist for Alfa Bank, was the nexus. It was Burt who helped draft Trump\u2019s foreign policy speech in April, and had been advising the Trump campaign, via Senator Jeff Sessions, on foreign policy. But when I met Burt at his office at the McLarty Associates lobbying shop, he looked at me and said he had never even met him. \u201cThe only person I talked to about Carter Page is this guy at the Washington Post,\u201d Burt told me. \u201cAnd I told him I\u2019d never met the guy. Let me put it this way: if I have met him, I\u2019ve forgotten. He\u2019s the former Merrill Lynch guy, right?\u201d\n\nSomeone else told me that the Page connection was Rick Dearborn, Sessions\u2019 chief of staff, who hired Page because Dearborn knew nothing about foreign policy but needed to put together a foreign policy staff for Trump\u2019s Alexandria, Virginia, policy shop and he happened to know Page. But Dearborn wouldn\u2019t return my calls, and someone who once worked for that policy shop told me it was neither Dearborn nor Burt, but campaign co-chair Sam Clovis who recruited Page. \u201cIf he was part of that original group of people, I can say with 70 percent confidence it was Sam Clovis,\u201d this person told me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not answering your questions,\u201d Clovis told me. He refused to tell me if he was the one who found Page, but Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s other spokesperson, says, \u201cCarter Page isn\u2019t someone I\u2019ve interacted with.\u201d Which confirmed what a policy staffer on the Trump campaign told me: \u201cCarter is a red herring, not a Rasputin. He\u2019s never met Trump, never briefed him. He has zero influence, none.\u201d\n\n***\n\nWas Page the shadowy messenger between the Kremlin and Trump Tower, or was he the nebbishy, not-very-successful man trying to profit from the arbitrage between what Trump said\u2014he\u2019s my adviser\u2014and what his associates said\u2014\u201cWho?\u201d Maybe I wasn\u2019t doing this right, and maybe everyone was lying to me, but it was hard not to come to the conclusion that, regardless of whatever game the Russians were running, Page was firmly in the latter camp.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about his Russia fund, other than it\u2019s never really materialized,\u201d says the prominent player in the energy space whom Page has pitched on various energy projects. \u201cEvery conversation I\u2019ve had with Carter has not been terribly serious. They\u2019ve all been pie-in-the-sky ideas. There are usually issues with traction and execution capabilities.\u201d He went on. \u201cI couldn\u2019t name a project that I could connect Carter\u2019s name to, any project that actually happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he\u2019s earned a living off this,\u201d the energy player says, \u201cbut I think he\u2019s been trying to be an intermediary. If you hang around Russia long enough, it\u2019s sort of like a pinball machine, something will hit you.\u201d\n\nStrangely, it was not a Russian pinball that hit him; it was Trump. According to the Trump policy adviser, this winter, Clovis began to draw up a list of people who could serve as policy advisers to the campaign and give it some intellectual and policy heft. At a time when established Republican foreign policy specialists were tripping over each other to get away from Trump, \u201ca lot of people came to Sam Clovis in February, March, and said, \u2018I want to be part of the team,\u2019\u201d says the Trump adviser. And that\u2019s how it happened. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy on a list. Trump looked at the list and said, \u2018He\u2019s an adviser.\u2019 And now he\u2019s milking it for all it\u2019s worth.\u201d\n\nNow, someone whom no one in the field had ever heard of was suddenly a Very Important Person in Washington\u2014or at least could plausibly market himself as one. \u201cI was not aware of him at all until he was named to the campaign, and even after that, I had never heard of him,\u201d one Russia specialist in Washington told me. He saw Page at a Washington roundtable in June for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and what he saw was a strange kind of person: one who was very differential to everyone there \u201cin a way that someone who is junior would use it to network,\u201d but who was dropping hints full of meaning to anyone who would listen\u2014and be impressed. \u201cHe was saying he was planning to go to Moscow,\u201d the Russia specialist recalls. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say what he was going to do there, but he created the impression that there could be some meaning to the trip.\u201d\n\nAccording to a congressional leadership staffer familiar with the intelligence briefings on Page\u2019s trip to Russia, \u201cthe meetings did happen and that\u2019s been established as a fact. I think the investigation is more what happened in them.\u201d But it remained unclear, the staffer told me unprompted, what this even meant. \u201cIt\u2019s not just did he met with them or not, but now looking into the bigger question of what the hell is going on?\u201d said the staffer. \u201cIs he acting as a conduit in ways that are against America\u2019s national security interests? Wittingly or un-, I should add. It\u2019s what\u2019s hard to parse about this. Is he doing this with nefarious intent or is this just about guys who are thrilled to be living in a John le Carr\u00e9 novel? Or are they being played by much smarter people in the Kremlin?\u201d\n\nThis seems to be vintage Carter Page, a man whose story never quite adds up, as much as he tries to make the numbers work. But he\u2019s also mastered the art of manipulating the distance between his story as it is and his story as he wants it to be, playing on the uncertainty in between to make himself seem more successful, more connected, even more evil than he really is\u2014and to try to turn a profit off of that. \u201cIf Page using his status as \u2018Trump advisor\u2019 for personal gain, that\u2019s another matter: Time for Page to join Twitter!\u201d Michael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, tweeted after news of the investigation broke. The Russians may be feeling out the Trump campaign via Page, but Page must be loving every minute of it. After all, meeting Russia\u2019s energy czar is an impossible dream for a would-be investor struggling to make it in the world of Russian energy\u2014but the dream entered the realm of the possible when Trump said three words in March: \u201cCarter Page, Ph.D.\u201d Now Carter Page, Ph.D., has found a perfect candidate to latch on to, like a pilot fish feeding off the carnage wrought by the oblivious Trump shark.\n\nFor months now, the American press has been twisting itself in knots trying to explain men like Page and Manafort, and, through them, to answer the questions of whether Putin is trying to destroy America by their hands, and is Trump a Kremlin stooge or a just a useful idiot, and is there even a difference?\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be one in the world of Trump, which in some ways resembles Putin\u2019s: the waters of truth are muddy and deeply suggestive. And that is all that matters. Is Putin actually meddling in our election and undermining the foundations of Western democracy in a massive way, or doing just enough to make us think he is, and thereby acquiring powers he holds only because we believe him to have them? \u201cI want to hope that this is connected with the growing influence and significance of Russia,\u201d Putin says of the rumors of Russian meddling in the American election\u2014as we in the media continue to squeegee them around, rarely really getting closer to the truth, and watching it disintegrate in our hands when we think we\u2019ve finally grasped it.\n\nJulia Ioffe is contributing writer at Politico Magazine."

	"text": "Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.\n\n\"If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,\" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.\n\nThe Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.\n\n\"Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.\"\n\nHe continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.\n\n\"It's tough being a police officer,\" Trump said. \"Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always \u2014 and it will be by them \u2014 vigorously addressed.\"\n\nBut aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.\n\nTrump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.\n\nDuring a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, \"We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,\"\n\nMany African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.\n\nTrump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.\n\n\"I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,\" said Trump. \"We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.\"\n\nBut this morning in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the \"violent disruptor\" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country\"s job \"to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great educations.\""

	"text": "\n\nPosted by Frank Wilkenmeyer on 19 Sep 2016\n\nDonald Trump Jr. Is quite possibly the dumbest person ever to take to social media. In the very least, it\u2019s a tossup between him and little brother Eric, who just yesterday made a fool of himself with his childish self-admiration for being the answer to a crossword puzzle question, along with free wifi, pushup bras and Bozo the Clown.\n\nTogether, the dimwitted duo provide enough social media fodder to make fun of them well into the next generation with posts to spare. When this election is finally over, it will be almost sad to see them fade back into oblivion. Maybe we\u2019ll keep track of their Twitter accounts just for a giggle every now and then.\n\nToday\u2019s silliness begins with Oompa Loompa Jr. pinning a tweet that is certainly relevant to a particularly volatile national discussion happening right now: Colin Kaepernick and the National Anthem. As more and more athletes decide to take a knee in protest to support Black Lives Matter, more and more conservatives trash them for it, calling them unpatriotic and demanding they stop getting media coverage. Lord Cheeto II has been one of the most vocal, accusing Kaepernick of disrespecting our troops and those who died for his freedom.\n\nFor the left, it\u2019s a simple matter of the 1st Amendment. Regardless of how you feel about the issue, these athletes have the right to express themselves. Yes, that means from government oppression and prosecution and not public criticism, but let\u2019s not forget that it\u2019s people like Little Comb-Over who are calling for police to stop providing protection for these athletes, for their employers to terminate their contracts and some have even gone so far as to suggest they be jailed for treason.\n\nFor years, we\u2019ve known that the only constitutional amendment conservatives care about is the second, so when this tweet appeared pinned to Mini Douche\u2019s Twitter account this morning, I couldn\u2019t help but bust out in hysterical laughter:\n\nClearly when you\u2019re the son of pure evil you have a hard time understanding the words you use. When \u201cliberals\u201d \u2014 otherwise known as \u201csane people\u201d \u2014 try to explain why people like Kaepernick and those who have followed his lead are expressing that very right, we\u2019re attacked in a frenzy of hate by people who think placing your hand over your heart and singing a song is mandatory patriotism. It\u2019s not. The first amendment is exactly today what it was when the founders added it to the framework of a growing nation in 1789; the right to be you.\n\nThe Supreme Court has sided with those \u201cliberals\u201d every time the issue of free speech is tied to something conservatives think should be compulsory, like the pledge of allegiance and school prayer. I\u2019ve said it already once in this article and thousands of times in my everyday life and I\u2019ll say it again: The 2nd Amendment is the only one they see as absolute. All others are open to the interpretation of some holier than thou asshole like Donald Trump Jr.\n\nFeatured image by Gage Skidmore"

	"text": "New York (CNN) Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals.\n\nBoth Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks.\n\nClinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.\n\nWhile the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday.\n\nTrump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader.\n\n\"I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,\" Trump said Monday on Fox News. \"I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over.\"\n\nHe later said, \"I've already met with a couple,\" but refused to say which ones.\n\nClinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president.\n\nClinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi.\n\nWhile reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the \"path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties.\"\n\nTrump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed \"the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,\" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting.\n\n\"Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,\" the Trump campaign said.\n\nThe Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his \"high regard for peace-loving Muslims,\" the campaign added.\n\nThe campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship \"vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East.\"\n\nSisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month.\n\nSitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily \"the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression.\" Clinton added that she was \"anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.\"\n\nClinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House.\n\n\"If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,\" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. \"While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins.\"\n\nThe meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.\n\nTrump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto earlier this year.\n\nThe meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it.\n\nClinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's \"embarrassing international incident.\"\n\n\"When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,\" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting.\n\nFor her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.\n\nInstead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.\n\nClinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.\n\nClinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian \"aggression\" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself.\n\nCurrently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians.\n\nClinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration.\n\nClinton, according to an aide in the room, \"emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress\" and \"discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS.\"\n\nClinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.\n\nClinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nSisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,\" the official said.\n\nTrump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who \"recognize that this ideology of death\" must be extinguished.\n\nClinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.\n\nClinton, according to an aide, discussed \"the threat from North Korea\" and \"relations with China\" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected.\n\nThere is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take."

In the 2012 presidential election, approximately 30 percent of the votes cast came via mail or early balloting, meaning many voters will weigh in before the candidates have had a chance to make their closing case.\n\nTypically, Democrats lead in early voting, especially in-person early voting, because their voters are not as likely to go out to the polls as Republicans, said Michael McDonald, an election expert and associate professor at the University of Florida. The GOP, however, tends to make up ground through mail in absentee ballots, McDonald said.\n\nHere\u2019s when early voting begins in each state.\n\n(Note, the below dates represent the earliest date that voters statewide can send for a ballot or vote in person without a special exemption.)\n\nAlabama \u2014 There\u2019s no universal early voting in Alabama, as voters need a state-approved excuse to vote absentee.\n\nAlaska \u2014 Oct. 24.\n\nArizona \u2014 Oct. 12.

The wall is being built to prevent illegal migrants from jumping onto vehicles preparing to cross the English Channel. The wall will cost an estimated two million pounds \u2014 about $2.5 million \u2014 and will be approximately 13 feet high.\n\nThere is a nearby migrant camp called \u201cthe Jungle\u201d that has been attacking vehicles in an attempt to climb aboard lorries and cars in order to enter the United Kingdom. The wall will be made out of concrete, which is more difficult to climb and will be extended by fences.\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now\n\nThe \u201cJungle\u201d now has more than 10,000 migrants and it has become a hotspot for violence. Police have called that area of Calais a \u201cno-go\u201d zone after dark, due to the endemic violence in the area. The migrants have been known to cause car crashes, leave debris on the road, thrown rocks off of bridges and started fires. They have also physically attacked drivers with bats, stabbed them with knives and even threatened people with chainsaws.\n\nIt is these attacks that encouraged Calais port chief executive Jean-Marc Puissesseau to support the wall. \u201cThis wall is going to prevent migrants from getting onto the road every night,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can no longer continue to put up with these repeated assaults.\u201d\n\nLiberals in the United Kingdom predictably opposed the construction of the wall, comparing it to the policies of Donald Trump. However, they don\u2019t offer any other alternatives to deal with the problems. Thankfully, the British government, along with the French, are not going to allow this kind of violence to continue."

But during the first general-election presidential debate, in Hempstead, New York, the real estate mogul vowed to release his tax returns \u201cagainst my lawyer\u2019s wishes\u201d if Clinton releases emails she deleted from a private server she used while she was secretary of state.\n\n\u201cAs soon as she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted, as soon as she releases them,\u201d Trump said tonight, amid cheers and applause, \u201cI will release my tax returns.\u201d\n\nThe White House hopefuls also clashed repeatedly over their tax plans during the debate, with Clinton accusing Trump of proposing the \u201cmost extreme version\u201d of \u201ctrickle-down economics.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in county than we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d the Democratic presidential nominee said from the stage. \u201cI call it trumped-up trickle-down because that\u2019s exactly what it would be.

I don't buy that.\u201d\n\nTrump, who released his tax plan earlier this month, has proposed tax cuts across the board, including income tax reductions for the top 1 percent and eliminating federal estate tax as well as gift taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, Clinton has called for tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans and closing corporate loopholes that allow the rich to evade some tariffs.\n\nTrump fired back, blaming \u201cpoliticians like Secretary Clinton\u201d for plunging the nation into debt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a debtor nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don\u2019t have the money because it\u2019s been squandered on so many of your ideas.\u201d\n\nClinton suggested that Trump\u2019s alleged failure to pay federal income tax might also be part of the problem.

	"text": "Obama Claims It Will Be A Personal Insult If You Don\u2019t Vote For Hillary [VIDEO]\n\nThis past Saturday night our Divider-in-Chief was at it again. This time he lectured the attendees at the 46th Annual Legislative Conference Phoenix Awards Dinner of the Congressional Black Caucus. What did he lecture them about? Hillary. Yep, he told them that he would be personally insulted if they didn\u2019t vote for Hillary.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cMy name may not be on the ballot but our progress is on the ballot. Tolerance is on the ballot. Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that\u2019s on the ballot right now. And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate whose defining principle, the central theme of hos candidacy is opposition to all that we have done. There\u2019s no such thing as a vote that doesn\u2019t matter. It all matters, and after we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election.

Buy Now\n\nWe definitely want to give you a sendoff Mr. President. And it can\u2019t be soon enough. But this business of being personally insulted if someone does not vote the way you tell them, is arrogant, not to mention juvenile. Get over it. If not voting for Hillary is an insult to you, then consider yourself insulted, because there are many Americans of every color who will not be voting for Hillary. And your legacy? You\u2019ve done a fine job of insulting your own legacy with all the disastrous decisions and programs you\u2019ve implemented. No one needs to help you insult your legacy, it\u2019s a mess.\n\nThe Democrat way is to shame people into voting the way they want them to. But the people in that room deserve the respect of not being lectured about who they MUST vote for. So save the preaching for those who want to hear it. Your legacy is one of causing division and Hillary will pick up where you left off, if she is elected. And that can\u2019t be fixed. Trump 2016."

	"text": "\"I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter,\" Sen. Mitch McConnell said. | Getty McConnell punts budget vote to buy time for deal\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delayed a procedural vote on a must-pass government spending measure Monday as top lawmakers remained at odds over a handful of provisions in the bill, even with a months-long impasse over Zika funding largely resolved.\n\nThe key vote is now scheduled for 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, McConnell said \u2014 giving negotiators more time to hammer out the fine print of the continuing resolution that will keep the federal government funded until Dec. 9. For now, however, sources said negotiators have settled on language that would provide money to battle the Zika virus while allowing Planned Parenthood\u2019s partner clinic in Puerto Rico to access the federal grants \u2014 a provision that had been a major point of contention.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans stand ready to move forward,\u201d McConnell (R-Ky.) said Monday. \u201cI would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to complete negotiations so we can advance this important matter.\u201d\n\nMcConnell spent about five minutes huddling with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Monday afternoon as they sought to strike a deal that would allow the Senate to recess as soon as the end of the week.\n\nBut the tentative resolution on Zika funding sets aside, for now, one of the toughest sticking points in the short-term spending measure. Senate Democrats had repeatedly filibustered a standalone Zika bill over restrictions that barred Planned Parenthood \u2014 particularly Profamilias, the health care provider\u2019s partner in Puerto Rico \u2014 from the federal funds. But in the CR, the Puerto Rico clinic would have access to the money, which would come through a $95 million social services block grant in a broader $1.1 billion Zika package, multiple sources said.\n\nLanguage in the emerging deal does not specify which providers are eligible or ineligible for funding, skirting a political landmine that\u2019s delayed Zika aid for months.\n\nDespite the breakthrough on emergency funding for the battle against the mosquito-borne disease, several wrinkles remain in the continuing negotiations. In a brief interview Monday morning, Reid said \u201cno\u201d when asked whether there would be a deal on government funding later in the day.\n\n\u201cClose is relative,\u201d Reid responded when asked whether an agreement was within reach.\n\nFor instance, funding for the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, continues to be in the mix. Democrats on both ends of the Capitol have lobbied for Flint funds to be included in the government spending package, in particular the aid package included in a Senate water resources bill.\n\nBut Republicans have similar demands: additional funding for flood-stricken Louisiana in the short-term spending measure. Both issues remained unresolved as of Monday evening, although senior Senate Democrats suggested they wouldn\u2019t accept flood aid without also getting money for Flint. Congressional leaders are also still hashing out how to pay for the Zika funding package.\n\n\u201cLouisiana is not resolved because [Republicans] want to do Louisiana, we want to do Flint,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Monday evening. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to do Flint.\u201d\n\nAnother issue that remains up in the air is a potential delay in the Obama administration\u2019s proposal to hand over the U.S. government\u2019s authority over the Internet domain system to an international body on Oct. 1 \u2014 a push that\u2019s being led by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and a host of other Republican lawmakers. If no deference is paid to Cruz and those lawmakers, the spending bill could turn into an internecine fight among Republicans \u2014 even with some pushback on the provision from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis is the coordination of the domain names. It\u2019s not who has control of the Internet,\u201d Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the committee with jurisdiction over the issue, said Monday. \u201cAnd every institution, nationally and internationally, have all said that this is the appropriate thing to do.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats want to include language restoring the ability of the Export-Import Bank to finance projects greater than $10 million \u2014 which it hasn\u2019t been able to do because three of the five seats on the bank\u2019s board are vacant. The Ex-Im issue is similarly toxic among Republicans, making it a difficult matter to take up ahead of an election.\n\nThere are other items that could fill up the Senate\u2019s legislative calendar this week before lawmakers return home until the November elections. Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) plan to force a Senate vote to block a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia that the Obama administration announced last month.\n\nSenate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said the exact timing of that vote was unclear, particularly because he would like to have the government funding measure resolved before moving on to other issues. Cornyn would also like to pair the arms sale vote with a roll call to formally override an expected veto by President Barack Obama of legislation that would allow family members of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism attacks to sue the government of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThough Obama has not yet vetoed the measure, he has until Friday to do so.\n\nRepublicans \u2014 who are eager to return home to campaign for reelection, particularly with control of the Senate in the balance \u2014 privately believe Democrats will try to drag out the negotiations as long as possible before the Sept. 30 deadline to pass government funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeather Caygle contributed to this report.\n\nAuthors:"

	"text": "72k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.\n\nInstead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.\n\nThere is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was \u201cno bigger jagoff in the world.\u201d\n\nThe indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets \u2014 that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.\n\nClinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton\u2019s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Trump\u2019s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.\n\nAn hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , \u201cIt sounds like you admitted you haven\u2019t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?\u201d Trump replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that at all.\u201d\n\nTrump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:\n\nI get audited every year my taxes are \u2014 it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of \u2014 do what the law recommends. But I\u2019m not against paying taxes. And I\u2019ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn\u2019t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I\u2019m, I\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that\u2019s been great to us. And you can\u2019t just take, take, take, take, take, take.\n\n.@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV \u2014 Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016\n\nThe contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\n\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump\u2019s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!"

	"text": "Trump hints Obama to blame for Charlotte unrest But he also presented himself as someone who could heal America's racial divide.\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a \u201cwounded country\u201d that \u201clooks bad to the world.\u201d\n\nPausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to heal America\u2019s racial divide.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cBefore going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAmerica desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and we\u2019ve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.\u201d\n\nHe called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d\n\nHe also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing \u201cthe best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers\u201d and sympathized with police officers, who carry an \u201cimmense responsibility\u201d but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot at Obama\u2019s leadership, or lack thereof.\n\n\u201cWe all have to walk a mile in someone else\u2019s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMany Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world\u2019s leader. How can we lead when we can\u2019t even control our own cities?\u201d\n\nTrump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president\u2019s responsibility \u201cto address this crisis and save African-American lives,\u201d has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.\n\nTrump's overtures to black voters \u2014 often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences \u2014 have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that \u201cdrugs are a very, very big factor\u201d in what's happening in Charlotte.\n\nStill, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d the Republican presidential nominee said there \u201cjust seems that there\u2019s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s a terrible thing that we\u2019re witnessing,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte \u2014 a great place \u2014 and you just see it.\u201d\n\nProtests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte.\n\nBy Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.\n\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.\n\nAt a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scott\u2019s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the family\u2019s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video \"can somehow help us reach that truth.\"\n\nJustin Bamberg, another of the family\u2019s attorney\u2019s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that \u201cpictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.\u201d He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scott\u2019s wife was present when he was shot.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,\u201d Bamberg said when asked why the family\u2019s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. \u201cYes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the \u201cdifficulties\u201d her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. \u201cI know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.\u201d\n\nWednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.\n\n\u201cI see it even going out. There\u2019s such a lack of \u2014 there\u2019s a lack of spirit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of something. Something\u2019s going on that\u2019s bad, and what\u2019s going on between police and others is getting worse.\u201d\n\nThe real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s wow, here we go again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad. When you look at what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s very sad. It\u2019s very divided, our country, and it\u2019s getting worse. I\u2019m not overly surprised to see it, but it\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nTrump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won\u2019t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.\n\n\u201cIf you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was \u2014 that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but there\u2019s something deeper than that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from America\u2019s current leader.\n\n\u201cWell, it really has to be \u2014 you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there\u2019s no unity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. It\u2019s so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, it\u2019s so sad to see. But there\u2019s just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.\u201d\n\nBut what Trump didn\u2019t say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obama\u2019s lack of leadership.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after we\u2019ve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think that\u2019s a tragic failure of leadership,\u201d Gingrich said.\n\n\u201cBut my guess is he was afraid it\u2019d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,\u201d he added. \u201cHe could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.\u201d\n\nGiuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Friday\u2019s shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was \u201ca more difficult situation\u201d than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the \u201cambiguous, troubling category.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut even there, you gotta say to people, \u2018Wait, let the investigation play out.\u2019 The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cThe president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.\u201d\n\nAuthors:"

Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9% and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3%.\n\nIn a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 7 points, 48% to 41%.\n\nThe poll was conducted after a rough patch for Clinton, highlighted by her temporarily leaving the campaign trail after she was diagnosed with pneumonia.\n\nDespite a recent effort to court African-American voters, Trump garners just 7% support compared to Clinton's 81% with the voting bloc.\n\nOn the issues, Trump has the advantage with voters when it comes to the economy -- 46% to 41%. But Clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%). Trump and Clinton are virtually tied when it comes to terrorism and homeland security (44% to 43%).\n\nA new CNN Poll of Polls, including the NBC/WSJ data, finds Clinton's edge over Trump has inched up by 1 point. The Poll of Polls averages the results of the five most recent nationwide telephone polls of presidential preference among likely voters and finds her ahead, 43% to 40%.\n\nThe NBC/WSJ poll surveyed 992 likely voters between September 16-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points."

Despite that, on Sunday in an interview that aired on \"60 Minutes,\" Johnson and running mate William Weld agreed with interviewer Steve Kroft that their ticket still has the ability to make an impact.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nJohnson said 70 percent of America do not know either him or Weld. At the end of the day, the former New Mexico governor said the Libertarian ticket is taking votes from both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"This is both sides, man, this is both barrels,\" Johnson said on the CBS news program. \"I'm not going to lose one minute of sleep ruining this two party monopoly that is going on. I think they are dinosaurs and I think we're the comet in this whole equation.

The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump\u2019s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue.\n\nBut it appears that Trump\u2019s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the \u201cbirther\u201d myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes.

	"text": "There is a moment at every Donald Trump rally when Donald Trump marvels at the crazy spectacle he\u2019s created. \u201cIs there any place in America as fun as a Donald Trump rally?\u201d he asks with a mischievous pursed-lip grin. The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming \u201cTRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!\u201d That\u2019s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,\u201d a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWhen Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn\u2019t a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama\u2014\u201cWe call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?\u201d\u2014and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say they\u2019re tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual.\n\nHis opponent does not. Clinton\u2019s events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the world\u2019s most famous and polarizing woman, but she\u2019s running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual.\n\nTonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas haven\u2019t been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you\u2019re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political game\u2014rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency\u2014and when 2016 is over, it\u2019s not clear whether those rules will still apply.\n\nWhatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who\u2019s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like \u201cLove Trumps Hate\u201d or \u201cStronger Together.\u201d The small venues are selected to target niche groups\u2014millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando\u2014and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive.\n\n\u201cI thought it was very substantial, very specific,\u201d Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a \u201cHil Yes!\u201d pin to Clinton\u2019s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. \u201cThe purpose wasn\u2019t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We\u2019re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.\u201d\n\nClinton had better hope not. There\u2019s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can\u2019t match. It\u2019s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you\u2019re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It\u2019s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (\u201cIt\u2019s 100 degrees in here. And that\u2019s considered cool for an auditorium.\u201d) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell\u2014the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world\u2014then moves onto another before the last fully explodes.\n\nClinton doesn\u2019t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump\u2019s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn\u2019t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic.\n\nNobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton\u2019s campaign, like his accusations that it\u2019s \u201cpolicy-free,\u201d when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there\u2019s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches\u2014he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long\u2014with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in.\n\n\u201cBom. Bom. Bom. See ya!\u201d Trump smirked. \u201cSee ya! I\u2019m going home.\u201d\n\nMany Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump\u2019s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he\u2019s shredding every day.\n\n***\n\nBefore attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I\u2019m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz\u2019s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet.\n\nTrump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the \u201cbad, dishonest, very bad people\u201d in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word \u201csir\u201d to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as \u201ca big fat bubble,\u201d and predicted a collapse that would be \u201cbeautiful to watch.\u201d He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: \u201cI didn\u2019t put him there! I\u2019m not paying him!\u201d He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself \u201cmore militaristic than anyone in this room,\u201d complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year\u2014actually the president\u2019s salary\u2014and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled.\n\n\u201cWhoever the hell brought this mic system\u2014don\u2019t pay the son of a bitch!\u201d he seethed. \u201cDon\u2019t pay em. Don\u2019t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn\u2019t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they\u2019ll pay, they don\u2019t care. So we\u2019re not going to pay. I guarantee, I\u2019m not paying for this mic.\u201d\n\nSo I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola\u2019s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: \u201cTyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!\u201d The crowd started chanting \u201cLOCK HER UP!\u201d before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and\u2026well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said one Trump supporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty\u2026 Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nTrump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clich\u00e9s and Republican talking points about \u201cencrusted insiders\u201d and \u201cturning the page.\u201d He said the kind of things regular politicians say: \u201cThe history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.\u201d And: \u201cOnce again, we\u2019ll have a government of, by, and for the people.\u201d He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd\u2014during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: \u201cWhat about white people?\u201d\u2014but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall\u2014but really, who still thinks about them?\n\nAfterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn\u2019t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing \u201call the problems in the world,\u201d including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that \u201cpersonally, I think she\u2019s an unstable person,\u201d and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone \u201cright smack in the middle of the heart\u2014and she wouldn\u2019t be prosecuted, OK?\u201d He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin\u2014and then he had cozied up again: \u201cHe\u2019s been nice to me, and if he\u2019s nice to me, that\u2019s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn\u2019t be so bad, would it?\u201d And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that \u201cthe country is collapsing.\u201d\n\nThose all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We\u2019re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military \u201cincredibly weak,\u201d defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community\u2014which endured slavery and Jim Crow\u2014was \u201cin the worst shape they\u2019ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!\u201d Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline \u201cRestraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.\u201d Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton\u2019s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn\u2019t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn\u2019t make it through one.\n\nThat sort of behavior just hasn\u2019t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it\u2019s that defiant you-can\u2019t-tell-me-what-I\u2019m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. \u201cHe\u2019s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people\u2019s feelings, always watching our P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, so it\u2019s cool to see him speak his mind,\u201d said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing\u2014he doesn\u2019t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn\u2019t stumble around like she did on the video\u2014Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: \u201cHe\u2019ll call a spade a spade, and if you don\u2019t like it you can shove it.\u201d Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s freeing up our speech,\u201d said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. \u201cWe can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we\u2019re offensive. Maybe we\u2019ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off\u2014at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn\u2019t want hate in their state: \u201cLazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!\u201d He explained to me that America was under siege, with \u201cthousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,\u201d and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\nThe Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition\u2014and they seemed less anxious than pissed off.\n\nOne of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: \u201cWe want our state rights back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,\u201d says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don\u2019t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. \u201cTrump is saying what we\u2019re all thinking: \u2018Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don\u2019t end where your feelings begin!\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as \u201cthe oldest play in the Democratic playbook.\u201d And he\u2019s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it\u2019s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: \u201cI\u2019ll say it openly, and some people don\u2019t like it, I don\u2019t really care: What do you have to lose?\u201d His long riffs about how he\u2019ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can\u2019t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don\u2019t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent\u2014the real rate is about one third of that\u2014he\u2019s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya\u2014and many I spoke to believe he\u2019s also a Muslim who supports ISIS.\n\nOne notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. \u201cA lot of us who like him don\u2019t like the stuff he says about race,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cObviously, some do.\u201d\n\nThis really isn\u2019t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal\u2014a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams\u2014she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak.\n\nI remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it.\n\nIn 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She\u2019s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn\u2019t been about standard anything.\n\n***\n\nNearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton\u2019s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an \u201cInclusive Economy,\u201d to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters\u2014a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse\u2014about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton\u2019s concern about a worthy issue.\n\nIt did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a nice speech,\u201d Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. \u201cNot very exciting, but I believe she\u2019ll do what she says.\u201d\n\nThe speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer\u2019s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators.\n\nThe rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: \u201cAcross the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They\u2019re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.\u201d Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. \u201cIn the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,\u201d Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value.\n\nClinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children\u2019s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department\u2019s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she\u2019s known\u2014including the \u201cunbelievably good-looking\u201d actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that \u201cfamily values\u201d should mean that every family has value\u2014and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the \u201csub-minimum wage\u201d that is currently paid to some disabled workers.\n\nThe audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a \u201creally slow, vicious death\u201d to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn\u2019t feel bad if they\u2019re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton\u2019s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton\u2019s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn\u2019t even mention Trump\u2019s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics.\n\nGeannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter.\n\n\n\n\u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nIn fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down\u2019s Syndrome and lead a productive life. \u201cWhat Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,\u201d Kilsheimer said. \u201cI know a lot of people don\u2019t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she\u2019s got heart.\u201d\n\nGeannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton\u2019s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. \u201cBelieve me, I\u2019ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,\u201d she said. \u201cTrump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.\u201d\n\nPolitical scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they\u2019re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren\u2019t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it\u2019s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump\u2019s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. \u201cMy daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We\u2019ve got plenty to lose,\u201d said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. \u201cThere\u2019s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.\u201d\n\nMany Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump\u2019s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. \u201cHe thinks we\u2019re all Mexicans, and we\u2019re all bad,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they\u2019ll come out to stop Trump.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. \u201cShe\u2019s OK, I guess,\u201d said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. \u201cMy main worry is Trump\u2019s fingers on the nuclear code. But I\u2019d say she knows what she\u2019s doing.\u201d In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they\u2019re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she\u2019s a typical lying politician, so they\u2019re voting for Trump\u2014and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they\u2019re staying home.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s great on the issues, but it\u2019s hard to get people to focus on that.\u201d\n\nClinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband\u2019s administration and recovery during Obama\u2019s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. \u201cWhen Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,\u201d said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. \u201cMan, Hillary should talk about that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn\u2019t focused on his policies, because they\u2019re so insubstantial and flexible, because he\u2019s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It\u2019s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump\u2019s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump.\n\nSo Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They\u2019ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it.\n\n***\n\nTonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump\u2019s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump\u2019s political brand is all about breaking the rules.\n\nWhat is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president\u2019s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can\u2019t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight\u2019s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won\u2019t be normal, but it won\u2019t be the first time, either.\n\nAnd yes, even though she\u2019s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo\u2014not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She\u2019s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn\u2019t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn\u2019t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they\u2019ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event.\n\nBut the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren\u2019t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they\u2019re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values\u2014showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren\u2019t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences\u2014that have constrained politicians in a good way. It\u2019s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they\u2019re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.\n\nMichael Grunwald is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine."

	"text": "A 22-year-old Muslim man from Afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in Afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Express reports:\n\nJama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein.\n\nThe toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the child\u2019s mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles.\n\nDuring the trial Jama B. boasted: \u201cI\u2019m a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\nJudge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: \u201cit was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child.\n\n\u201cTherefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He\u2019s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nJama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime.\n\nA second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence.\n\nProsecutor Axel Bieler said, \u201cRape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case.\n\n\u201cTherefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.\u201d\n\nSay what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure.\n\nKarin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, \u201cThe court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,\u201d she added. \u201cHe is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s even worse is the comments by the family\u2019s attorney.\n\n\u201cIt was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,\u201d Peter Boysen said. \u201cTherefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict.

Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough.

	"text": "72k SHARES SHARE THIS STORY\n\nThe first debate showdown of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was expected to be a brutal altercation between the two candidates.\n\nInstead, the viewing audience was treated to a one-sided destruction with Clinton appearing cool and presidential, while Trump gave the worst debate performance in presidential history. Each candidate had the ability to invite guests for moral support, and Clinton invited billionaire Mark Cuban who has been one of the loudest voices against Trump in the media.\n\nThere is no love lost between the two businessmen, and Cuban even said of Trump there was \u201cno bigger jagoff in the world.\u201d\n\nThe indebted businessman happily admitted on stage in front of Cuban to being in debt at least $600 million. The shameless Trump, who became more unhinged as the night progressed, freely gave away one of his biggest secrets \u2014 that he does not and has not paid any federal taxes in years.\n\nClinton speculated about this, and like a predictable rube under the hot lights Trump cracked under the pressure. Rather than offer an explanation or deflection to Clinton\u2019s hypothesis Trump agreed he paid no taxes and said, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Trump\u2019s cheap explanation sounded like something a third grader on the playground would offer rather than a presidential candidate.\n\nAn hour after the debate Trump immediately began walking back his statement, and denied he had ever said it. This type of shamelessness is difficult to combat. When asked , \u201cIt sounds like you admitted you haven\u2019t paid federal taxes and that was smart. Is that what you meant to say?\u201d Trump replied, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that at all.\u201d\n\nTrump insulted every American who pays their fair share of taxes and Cuban was not amused nor impressed. After the debate Cuban said:\n\nI get audited every year my taxes are \u2014 it takes me 45 minutes just to sign all the different taxes that I have to spend. And I tell my tax lawyers and everybody, you know, take advantage of \u2014 do what the law recommends. But I\u2019m not against paying taxes. And I\u2019ll give you a perfect example. When the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn\u2019t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury. This year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I\u2019m, I\u2019m the luckiest guy in the world. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that\u2019s been great to us. And you can\u2019t just take, take, take, take, take, take.\n\n.@mcuban on Trump saying not paying taxes makes him smart #debatenight pic.twitter.com/uPNunatukV \u2014 Stefan Becket (@becket) September 27, 2016\n\nThe contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\n\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump\u2019s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!"

	"text": "Early voting has begun in the battleground state of North Carolina, and after months of contentious litigation, it\u2019s clear why Republicans wanted to squash it: returns are showing Democrats with an eight point advantage over Republicans.\n\nData analysis from TargetSmart (who partnered with NBC News) shows that of the 4,000 plus presidential ballots that have been cast, 42 percent come from registered Democrats, 34 percent from Republicans, 25 percent from unaffiliated, and 1 percent from Libertarians.\n\nContrast that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won North Carolina by two percent: in early voting that year in that state, Republicans held a five percent lead. Now Democrats hold an eight percent lead. In 2008, when President Obama won (by a slim margin of 0.33 percent), Democrats had an 11 point advantage. In 2004, Democrats had an 11 point advantage, but Kerry lost to Bush by 13 percent.\n\nSo while it\u2019s not set in stone that whoever accumulates the most early votes wins, the last two elections (in which early voting has increased tremendously) shows that is the case.\n\nNate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight currently gives Clinton a 43 percent chance of winning North Carolina (and a 62 percent chance of winning the election overall). Clinton\u2019s chances have gone up almost five percent in the last week, with one reason being a strong showing for Democrats in early voting. The New York Times\u2019 election model gives Clinton a 48 percent chance of winning North Carolina.\n\nAgain, no wonder Governor Pat McCory, who is currently losing his re-election bid, and the GOP legislature wanted to do away with it. When Democrats get a head start, that usually means good news in November.\n\nDemocrats shouldn\u2019t get too comfortable. Although early voting points to a Democratic-leaning result, Republicans could very well (and chances are great) benefit from in person voting on November 8. President Obama never overcame Romney in the polls in the weeks leading up to the election, almost all the polls for the month of September favored Obama.\n\nWith 45 days left until the election, anything can happen, so Democrats need to continue to mobilize, register, and get out the vote for not just early ballots, but for November 8.\n\nRachel Maddow broke down the facts on her show:\n\nFeatured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"

	"text": "In the first half of the debate, Donald Trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldn\u2019t stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)?\n\nHoward Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs.\n\nDean, who is now a contributor for MSNBC, tweeted last night:\n\nNotice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? \u2014 Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016\n\nTrump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system.\n\nAnd considering he hasn\u2019t released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state.\n\nOf course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be.\n\nDean\u2019s assertion is just that \u2014 an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made against their candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything she\u2019s not.\n\nIf this debate showed one thing, it\u2019s that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is.\n\nFeatured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images"

	"text": "KALLSTADT, Germany \u2014 Few places in Germany are as representative of the country\u2019s heartland as Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s grandfather was born \u2014 and from which he was later deported.\n\nThe hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half\u2019s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig\u2019s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.\n\nTrump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.\n\nIn fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\n\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. \u201cWith his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,\u201d Steiniger tells POLITICO.\n\nTrump\u2019s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. \u201cHe stands for everything that\u2019s bad,\u201d says Sarah B\u00fchler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town\u2019s main square. B\u00fchler is a former local \u201cwine princess,\u201d the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\n\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the town\u2019s annual festival: Saumagen-D\u00f6ner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. \u201cEveryone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,\u201d says B\u00fchler. \u201cPink, purple, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. \u201cThey don\u2019t get that we really don\u2019t give a damn about Trump,\u201d says Huber. \u201cHe\u2019s never been here, and he apparently doesn\u2019t care about us, either.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nDonald\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner\u2019s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including \u201cTrump,\u201d \u201cDromb\u201d and \u201cTrumpff,\u201d according to local historians, or even \u201cDrumpf,\u201d according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on \u201cTrump.\u201d\n\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\n\nFriedrich\u2019s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\n\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. \u201cBoth he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,\u201d said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\n\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship \u201cas his own request\u201d four years after arriving in the U.S.\n\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\n\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. \u201cMy grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\n\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended \u201cto return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,\u201d he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair\u2019s family history.\n\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was \u201cto be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.\u201d\n\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife \u2014 pregnant once more \u2014 had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald\u2019s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\n\n\u201c[The authorities] said, \u2018You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,\u201d says Walter. \u201cSo they left and they went back to America, and that\u2019s why Donald and I are here.\u201d\n\nFriedrich \u2014 now named Frederick \u2014 died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\n\n* * *\n\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on \u201cKings of Kallstadt,\u201d a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\n\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump\u2019s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\n\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower\u2019s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\n\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump\u2019s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. \u201cHis assistant just couldn\u2019t be bothered,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cHello, John,\u201d Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin\u2019s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.\n\nTrump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York\u2019s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. \u201cAfterwards, I just kept on thinking, \u2018What on earth did I do?\u2019\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe cake looks really good,\u201d Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.\n\nUntil 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. \u201cThey grow them well in Kallstadt,\u201d he told her during their meeting. \u201cThey grow them very well. Believe me. It\u2019s good stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nWhen their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump\u2019s son, Eric Trump.\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard the word Kallstadt?\u201d Wendel asked him.\n\n\u201cKallstadt?\u201d Trump Junior replied, \u201cNo, what is it?\u201d"

I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for.\"\n\nThe tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: \"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\" -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it \"disgusting\" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane.\n\nBut Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet.\n\nMars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, \"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\"\n\nRead More"

	"text": "2.1k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nFor the past week rioters have been wrecking havok all across Charlotte. The riots are in response to the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, which has been cited as just the latest example of an unarmed black man killed by racist police brutality. Scott\u2019s wife, who filmed the shooting, told police that he wasn\u2019t armed and was only carrying a book.\n\nAs usual, the shooting happened under circumstances much more murky than those citing this as an unjustified act of police violence would like to admit. There was in fact a gun recovered at the scene, and there was a holster on Scott\u2019s leg spotted in the police dash-cam footage. Those citing this as yet another \u201cproof\u201d that police are racist should know that the officer who shot Scott was black himself, so race was not a motivating factor in the shooting.\n\nAs it turns out, Scott has a history of violence, and there\u2019s no reason to think he wouldn\u2019t have used his firearm if he had the chance. As Bearing Arms reported:\n\nRakeyia Scott\u2019s cry to CMPD officers that her husband, Keith Lamont Scott, did not own a gun\u2014even as he brandished a gun in front of them\u2014now appears to be a calculated lie, according to Rakeyia Scott. On Oct. 5, a Gaston County District Court judge granted his wife a temporary restraining order. The court order told Scott not to go near his wife, three of their children and the children\u2019s schools. He was not allowed near their Gastonia apartment they\u2019d called home since April 2014, according to court documents. He was told to turn over a black 9mm handgun he owned illegally. Eleven days later, Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed the order against her husband, writing, \u201cHe is no longer a threat to me and my family.\u201d But three days before she got the order, Keith Scott had kicked her, punched their 8-year-old in the head three times and threatened to kill her with the gun, she had written. \u201cHe said he is a \u2018killer\u2019 and we should know that,\u201d she wrote. She said the man she\u2019d been married to since she was 18 did not have a gun permit and was a felon, having been incarcerated from April 2004 to April 2011. She checked a box saying her husband had threatened her with the gun before.\n\nThe Scott family is now trying to claim that the head injuries suffered by Scott left him a changed man, and yet, he was still an armed felon, brandishing a gun, if not threatening with her at this time. Yeah \u2013 OK.\n\nScott\u2019s wife told officers he didn\u2019t own a firearm during the altercation, which was clearly a lie, and one that could\u2019ve gotten them killed. While rioters destroy Charlotte, they\u2019re doing so over a man who could\u2019ve killed those officers, and had a wife that he himself once threatened would\u2019ve been an accomplice to their murders."

You know who could beat Hillary Clinton? Marco Rubio, and I disagree with him on the Gang of Eight, and there\u2019s about 80 percent that I do agree with him on, and he\u2019s kind of a politician, but he\u2019s a different kind of politician. He\u2019s a young politician. He\u2019s a Hispanic, He can win. Let\u2019s go for it.\u2019\"\n\nInstead, Beck sought \u201ca truly honorable man\u201d in Cruz \u2014 \u201cand that will always let you down,\u201d he said. But while lamenting the fact that Cruz chose to be a politician Friday, Beck said that he believes the Texas firebrand is still a good man.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna condemn him. He is still, I believe, a good man,\u201d Beck said. \u201cHe is just a politician first. I\u2019ve never put him into the category of a politician, and that\u2019s my fault. He is a politician.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Cruz insisted to Beck Monday that he was trying to show the Trump campaign how to earn his vote with his floor speech at the Republican National Convention in which he encouraged Republicans to vote their conscience in November.\n\nAfter Beck noted that Cruz failed to answer a question this past weekend about whether the real estate mogul was fit to be president, the senator explained that the presidential election is a binary choice, a conclusion he reached after whittling down five possible options (Vote for Trump, for Clinton, a third-party candidate, write in a candidate or abstain).\n\n\u201cSo a man who has principles who says there are lines I will not cross \u2014 it\u2019s still a binary choice, so a man who you cannot come on and say, \u2018Yes, Glenn, he is fit to be president of the United States,\u2019 I still am encouraged by you to abandon my principles and vote because it\u2019s a binary choice?\u201d Beck asked.\n\n\u201cYou are encouraged by me to do what you believe is right and honorable in principle,\u201d Cruz shot back, warning of the damage he said Clinton would do to America.\n\nBeck, however, wasn\u2019t satisfied. \u201cThis is information that you had in Cleveland \u2014 and hang on just a second before you respond \u2014 you had all of this information. You had this information the day you dropped out of the race and said that Donald Trump is a sociopathic liar,\u201d Beck said. \u201cSo you had all this information. Have you spent an enormous amount of time with Donald Trump? Do you have new information that has made you say: \u2018Oh, my gosh, he\u2019s now not a sociopathic liar. He is not the guy I very eloquently spelled out for over a year, and now suddenly there\u2019s a reason to believe him.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite his \u201csignificant disagreements\u201d with Trump, Cruz said, it\u2019s a binary choice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking for new information. I\u2019m asking you for new information,\u201d Beck said. \u201cYou knew all the things that you\u2019re saying today. The time to do that would have been the day you pulled out or the day that you gave the speech so eloquently. Why now? What\u2019s new?\u201d\n\nCruz pointed to the Trump campaign\u2019s release of possible conservative Supreme Court nominees, a list that includes Cruz ally Utah Sen. Mike Lee. He suggested he had a hand in the list, noting that the Supreme Court was an issue he raised with vice presidential nominee Mike Pence when he asked the Texas senator what it would take to get him on board.\n\n\u201cWe discussed the Supreme Court as being one of the great checks protecting the Constitution and the rule of law, and the Trump campaign committing to nominate from that list was an important change that gave me significant reassurance that helped me get to the point of saying yes,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nAfter Stu Burguiere pressed Cruz on why he would believe anything Trump says, he rattled off a series of principles at stake. \u201cNow, with respect to the justices Donald Trump would nominate, I know that he is publicly committing to nominate from a list that is very strong, and if he were to nominate from that list, it would be a major step towards protecting our rights,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI hope that he would follow through on that commitment. One never knows if one will, but the fact that he is public promising \u2018I will nominate from these 21,\u2019 I think creates a dynamic where, compared to Hillary, who is promising to put left-wing ideologues, that\u2019s a clear choice.\u201d\n\nCruz also disagreed with the wide interpretation that his RNC remarks were a swipe against Trump, adding that he\u2019s always been \u201cNever Hillary\u201d but not ever \u201cNever Trump.\u201d He also said he gleaned parts of his speech from what Ronald Reagan said about Gerald Ford and what Ted Kennedy said about Jimmy Carter.\n\n\u201cMy speech drew deliberately from both of those speeches,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cBoth of those speeches at the time were treated effectively as endorsement speeches. One of the unfortunate things about the reaction is Cleveland is that for many who were watching, it was perceived that I was essentially embracing Never Trump. I have never been a Never Trumper.\u201d\n\nAfter Cruz\u2019s appearance, Beck said Cruz would have been better of just telling the truth about why he backed Trump. \u201cHe could have come on and said, \u2018Look, guys, here\u2019s the thing, my supporters are yelling at me,\u2019 and I know that, because so are mine,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019My donors, who are all in with the GOP, they\u2019re all saying I\u2019ll never fund \u2014 I won\u2019t fund you for the Senate. I won\u2019t fund you for the run in 2020. And I have to make a decision. So the question is do I completely shut myself out of this game or do I play the game as much as I possibly can?\u2019\u201d\n\nAuthors:"

Don\u2019t even read further if you are part of the man\u2019s best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning.

The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loung\u2019s owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. What\u2019s truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.\n\n\u00d7 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now\n\nLocal people in the village of Ban Nong Khon in Chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog.\n\nMany people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loung\u2019s true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.\n\nLoung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since.\n\nA dog lover\u2019s club in Thailand has donated money for the funeral expenses of Loung\u2026hoping to give a proper burial for such a loyal animal."

We will respectfully refrain from further commentary as anything we say could be misinterpreted as marketing.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign is so repugnant that even candy makers have to speak out. This meme is racist, disgusting, and is just another sign of what a morally bankrupt family the Trumps are. Do everything you can to keep them out of the White House, folks.

	"text": "Washington Since we last updated the CNN battleground map, Donald Trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.\n\nAnd, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency.\n\nWith four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate.\n\n\n\nHear CNN Political Director David Chalian explain the new race ratings in his podast:\n\nWhat's changed?\n\n-- Iowa (6) moves from from \"battleground\" to \"lean Republican\"\n\n-- Utah (6) moves from \"lean Republican\" to \"solid Republican\"\n\n-- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from \"solid Democrat\" to \"battleground\"\n\n-- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from \"solid Republican\" to \"battleground\"\n\nRoad to 270: Electoral College map\n\nNote: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines.\n\nThe state of play\n\nDonald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up \"battleground\" category into the \"lean Republican\" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.\n\nThat leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.\n\nMaine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from \"solid Democrat\" to \"battleground\" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from \"solid Republican\" to \"battleground,\" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.\n\nFinally, Utah moves back from \"leaning Republican\" to being solidly being in Trump's column.\n\nThere is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging.\n\nFor all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump.\n\nIt is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall.\n\nThat's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio.\n\nClinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.\n\nSolid Republican:\n\nAlabama (9), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (3), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (38), Utah (6)West Virginia (5), Wyoming (3) (163 total)\n\nLeans Republican:\n\nArizona (11), Georgia (16), Iowa (6), (33 total)\n\nBattleground states:\n\nFlorida (29), Nevada (6), Ohio (18), Maine 2nd Congressional District (1) Nebraska 2nd Congressional District (1), North Carolina (15) (70 total)\n\nLeans Democratic:\n\nColorado (9), Michigan (16), New Hampshire (4), Pennsylvania (20), Virginia (13), Wisconsin (10), (72 total)\n\nSolid Democratic:\n\nCalifornia (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), DC (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maine (3), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3), Washington (12), Minnesota (10), New Mexico (5) (200 total)"

We never had problems like this \u2026 Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that\u2019s a big change, and I think that\u2019s the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.\u201d\n\nThis perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance \u2013 blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy.\n\nSupporting her candidate\u2019s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that \u201cif you\u2019re black and you haven\u2019t been successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You\u2019ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn\u2019t have. You had all the advantages and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. It\u2019s not our fault, certainly.\u201d\n\nTo put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that \u201cthe Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time\u201d and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans \u201cwere raised.\u201d\n\nIn one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface.\n\nShe is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied \u201cI don\u2019t care, it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\nThe Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nUPDATE: Kathy Miller has resigned her from her position with the Trump campaign and has issued an apology. It should be noted the Trump campaign has yet to apologize for anything this campaign season.\n\nWatch it here \u2013 her remarks begin at 4:40:\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!"

Ever since an improvised explosive device injured 29 in Chelsea, New York City, Trump and his goons have revived one of their favorite talking points \u2013 vilifying Syrian refugees. \u201cThese attacks and many others were made possible because of our extremely open immigration system, which fails to properly vet and screen the individuals or families coming into our country\u201d yelled Trump at one of his notorious hate-rallies on September 19th.\n\nHe later went on FOX News and in one broad stroke, painted all immigrants with outrageous hyperbole: \u201cThink of it, Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands of these same people that are, you know, they have such hatred and sickness in their heart. It\u2019s sickness, and it\u2019s hatred, and she wants to allow hundreds of thousands more to come in.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Mr. Trump, the truth is the bombing was committed by a naturalized American citizen \u2013 and authorities caught the suspect thanks to a Sikh immigrant, Harinder Bains. He is the owner of the bar in whose doorway Ahmad Rahami decided to take a nap in. When Bains saw the man\u2019s face on CNN, he did what any responsible citizen would do.\n\nHe called the cops.\n\n\u201cI did what I think every American would have done. My neighbor would have done the same thing. Any Jewish, Christian, Sikh, Muslim. Anybody would have done the same thing\u2026I\u2019m from Sikh faith. I\u2019ve been taught always stand up against the atrocities, any kind of persecution\u201d said Bains to CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo.\n\nHe\u2019s absolutely right \u2013 because our nation is a nation of immigrants. All of our forefathers are immigrants who colonized this land and committed genocide against the native peoples. Nobody has any more or less of a right to be here than everyone else, and picking on Syrian refugees because they\u2019re Muslims fleeing chlorine gas and barrel bombs is the lowest of the low. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States.\n\nThe chance of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack is 1 in 3.6 billion; you are at much more danger from your own countrymen and their firearms. Mr. Bains\u2019 actions reaffirm the notion that unity and welcome are our greatest assets. When immigrants feel accepted by a community, it becomes their community and they will work just as hard to defend it as anyone would.\n\nFor instance, the Orlando shooter was reported to the FBI by an immigrant at his local mosque after he discovered evidence of Mateen\u2019s radicalization; racist Trump supporters repaid him by burning his house of worship to the ground. Mr. Trump and his campaign\u2019s racist rhetoric only serves to drive us apart and puts us in more danger. He is the real threat to America \u2013 not refugee or immigrants.\n\nAdd your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President\u2019s crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!"

	"text": "A billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his father\u2019s inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. But in this case it\u2019s not Donald Trump. It\u2019s Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot.\n\nLike Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginia\u2019s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trump\u2019s strongest states.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWest Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49\u201331 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders\u2019 51 percent in the state\u2019s May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win.\n\nThat\u2019s led to a dynamic in which West Virginia\u2019s GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. It\u2019s very nearly the opposite of what\u2019s happening in other states with close races.\n\n\u201cAcross the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, it\u2019s pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,\u201d says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cThis is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.\u201d\n\nIn this race, Trump isn\u2019t a drag on Republicans; he\u2019s an asset.\n\nThe reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with \u201cwar on coal\u201d rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. It\u2019s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russia\u2019s OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price.\n\nCole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but he\u2019s no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools.\n\nIn a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket.\n\n\u201cIf you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,\u201d says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. \u201cIf you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are known\u2014the wall, universal health care, the coal industry\u2014but so much of what\u2019s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.\u201d\n\nJustice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. He\u2019s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he won\u2019t vote for Clinton and dismissed Cole\u2019s claim that he supports Obama as \u201ccomplete dog snot.\u201d\n\nAnd while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate \u201cisn\u2019t focused on the national political circus,\u201d the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. \u201cJim is no politician,\u201d says Herring. \u201cHe is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent.\n\nMany doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. \u201cDo I think Justice has a lead? Yes,\u201d says Gates. \u201cDo I think it\u2019s double digits? No.\u201d\n\nSome of that is because Justice\u2019s industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOP\u2019s otherwise effective \u201cwar on coal\u201d messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d says Dave \u201cMudcat\u201d Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said he\u2019s voting for Trump, says voters don\u2019t trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. \u201cShe said she\u2019s going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners don\u2019t want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,\u201d says one Democratic strategist.\n\nBut Saunders doesn\u2019t have kind words for Justice either: \u201cHe\u2019s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.\u201d\n\nCole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justice\u2019s business record over the next several weeks. \u201cJim Justice is a coal operator, but he\u2019s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,\u201d Gates says. \u201cHis legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.\u201d\n\nThat record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice \u201cstands out\u201d among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down.\n\nThe problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justice\u2019s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. That\u2019s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million.\n\nThe pattern apparently extends to Justice\u2019s other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court.\n\nJustice\u2019s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election.\n\nBoth Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy that\u2019s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census, West Virginia\u2019s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy.\n\nMines sit idle as a string of industry giants\u2014 Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energy\u2014filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it\u2019s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal.\n\nThe coal industry\u2019s struggles haven\u2019t just hurt West Virginia\u2019s employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward.\n\nJustice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, he\u2019s brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints\u2019 training camp to the Greenbrier.\n\nIn late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.\n\nJustice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrier\u2019s reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment.\n\nWhether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governor\u2019s race from \u201cLeans Republican\u201d to \u201cToss-up.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,\u201d Kondik says.\n\nTrump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governor\u2019s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. That\u2019s why Cole\u2019s campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesn\u2019t matter, so long as they\u2019re not voting for Justice.\n\nIn his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: \u201cAt the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do what\u2019s best for Jim Justice.\u201d\n\nThat line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether what\u2019s in Justice and Trump\u2019s best interests is in theirs, too.\n\nMason Adams writes from southwest Virginia.

On Sunday, five explosive devices were discovered at an Elizabeth train station.\n\nNew Jersey State Police said Monday, citing the FBI, that the bombings in Chelsea and the New Jersey shore town Seaside Park were connected. No one was injured in the Jersey blast.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said as investigators gathered information they learned there were \"certain commonalities among the bombs,\" leading authorities to believe \"that there was a common group behind the bombs.\"\n\n\"We want to get this guy in for questioning,\" de Blasio said on CNN. \"We need the facts to be able to piece all this together. ... I think we're going to know a lot more in the course of the day. Things are moving very quickly.\"\n\nEarly Monday, FBI agents swarmed an apartment above a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth that's tied to Rahami. The activity came hours after one of five devices found at the nearby Elizabeth train station exploded while a bomb squad robot attempted to disarm it. No one was injured.\n\nSaturday night's blast in the bustling Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people, and another unexploded device made out of pressure cooker was found several blocks away. In the immediate aftermath of that bombing, de Blasio and Cuomo were careful to say there was no evidence of a link to international terrorism. Both said Monday that appears to be changing.\n\n\"The more we learn with each passing hour, is it looks more like terrorism,\" de Blasio said in a later interview on NY1 News.\n\nCuomo, in a separate interview on MSNBC, said: \"Today's information suggests it may be foreign related but we'll see where it goes. ... My operating premise is anytime, anywhere, seven days a week you could have an incident like this.\"\n\nThe White House said President Barack Obama was briefed throughout the night and early Monday on the investigation into bombs found in New York City and New Jersey. Spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama will comment publicly later Monday.\n\nOn Sunday night, FBI agents in Brooklyn stopped \"a vehicle of interest\" in the investigation of the Manhattan explosion, according to FBI spokeswoman Kelly Langmesser.\n\nShe wouldn't provide further details, but a government official and a law enforcement official who were briefed on the investigation told The Associated Press that five people in the car were being questioned at an FBI building in Manhattan.\n\nThe officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the ongoing investigation.\n\nNo one has been charged, and the investigation is continuing, Langmesser said.\n\nCuomo, touring the site of Saturday's blast in Chelsea, said the unexploded pressure cooker device appeared \"similar in design\" to the bomb that exploded in Chelsea.\n\nOn Sunday, a federal law enforcement official said the Chelsea bomb contained a residue of Tannerite, an explosive often used for target practice that can be picked up in many sporting goods stores. The discovery of Tannerite may be important as authorities probe whether the two New York City devices and the pipe bomb at the Jersey shore are connected.\n\nCellphones were discovered at the site of both bombings, but no Tannerite residue was identified in the New Jersey bomb remnants, in which a black powder was detected, said the official, who wasn't authorized to comment on an ongoing investigation and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe pipe bomb exploded Saturday in Seaside Park, New Jersey, before a charity 5K race to benefit Marines and sailors. The race was canceled and no one was injured.\n\nThe bombings in New York City and New Jersey happened the same day that a man stabbed and injured nine people at a Minnesota mall before an off-duty police officer fatally shot him. The St. Cloud police chief said the man reportedly made at least one reference to Allah and asked a victim if he or she was Muslim before attacking. The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility.\n\n\n\nAuthors:"

	"text": "Sen. Chuck Schumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio. | Getty Schumer transfers millions to Dems in bid for Senate takeover\n\nChuck Schumer is sitting on a mountain of cash. And now he\u2019s starting to dole it out to fellow Democrats who might make him majority leader.\n\nThe New York senator is transferring $1 million to the Senate Democrats\u2019 campaign arm on Tuesday. He\u2019s also given $3.2 million to state parties over the past week, Democratic sources said.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nEarlier this month, Schumer shifted an additional $2 million from his campaign war chest to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Altogether in September, Schumer has transferred $6.2 million of the $27 million he has on hand to help Democratic hopefuls.\n\nRepublicans control 54 seats, but Democrats are favored to win three back, so control of the chamber is seen as a toss-up. As the party begins making difficult decisions about where to spend and where to cut, a significant transfer from Schumer could go a long way.\n\n\u201cThe Kochs do not have a finite amount of money, they have unlimited money. We have a finite amount of money,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in an interview on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to allocate our resources so they\u2019re meaningful to us and our candidates.\u201d\n\nSchumer\u2019s money could give Democrats some breathing room as they slash expensive ad buys in Florida and Ohio and eye instead cheaper races in North Carolina and Missouri. No one has more to gain from a Democratic takeover of the Senate than Schumer, who will ascend to the leader job in 2017 as Reid retires after a 12-year stint as party head.\n\nSchumer\u2019s donation is both a vote of confidence in his party\u2019s candidates and a reflection of Democrats\u2019 future challenges. Democrats are defending 25 seats in 2018 compared with just eight GOP seats, so if Democrats come up short in November they are unlikely to take back the majority this decade.\n\nSchumer has also raised $2 million directly for candidates\u2019 committees, and a joint account that he leads has collected $800,000 combined for the DSCC and individual candidates. He\u2019s planning a fall event in New York to benefit Senate candidates that\u2019s projected to bring in \u201cupwards of another million,\u201d according to a person close to the New York senator.\n\n\u201cSchumer has been relentless,\u201d said a DSCC official.\n\nSchumer and Reid have also appeared at numerous events for Senate Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate hopefuls run by former aides to Reid, including his onetime chief of staff, Susan McCue. The group, which can accept unlimited donations from donors, has spent more than $30 million this cycle. Democrats complain that Republican super PACs have far outspent them.\n\n\u201cLeader Reid and Senator Schumer are working around the clock to raise awareness about the avalanche of money Republicans are pouring into Senate races through independent expenditures. The amounts are staggering,\u201d McCue said in a statement.\n\nSchumer still will have roughly $20 million on hand after the transfer. He is up for reelection in New York, with the latest polls showing him trouncing his GOP challenger by more than 40 points. However, if past is prologue, Schumer is likely to spend some money on it despite token opposition.\n\nSchumer spent about $13 million in 2010, but that was a historically bad year for Democrats. Schumer\u2019s colleagues won\u2019t rule out the possibility that he\u2019ll donate more to his party\u2019s Senate takeover effort.\n\n\u201cIf he thinks it will make a difference, he\u2019ll do it. He\u2019s very calculating,\u201d said a Democratic senator. \u201cChuck will be there if you need him.\u201d\n\nSen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a close ally of Schumer, agreed that the presumptive Democratic leader might provide more.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to watch everything closely. It\u2019s my sense he\u2019s 1,000 percent committed to taking back the Senate,\u201d Stabenow said.\n\nThere\u2019s no decision yet on where the DSCC might allocate the additional money from Schumer. It could go toward races in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania or Nevada, states that are all exceedingly close, or help compete in pricey Florida. Using the cash in red-leaning states is another option.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make some tough decisions, which haven\u2019t been made yet,\u201d Reid said.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has been outraised by the DSCC to the tune of $36 million. Outside groups like the Senate Leadership Fund are making up the difference, but Republican officials are leaning on their rank and file to help fill the campaign coffers, with McConnell coming up with nearly $4 million in transfers thus far. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) made a big splash with a $2 million transfer, but even though he has millions more on hand, Thune said he\u2019ll need to hang on to the rest of his cash.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can probably keep pace with Schumer,\u201d Thune said in an interview.\n\nRepublicans are now trying to wring every last bit out of their members, after Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama spurned transferring any of his $10 million. Now the GOP hopes that NRSC Vice Chairs Dean Heller of Nevada and Tom Cotton of Arkansas may make a last-minute transfer. They have yet to give money directly to the group, GOP sources said, though they have helped raise funds directly for the NRSC. The third vice chair Joni Ernst of Iowa gave last week, an aide said Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublicans, however, simply don\u2019t have their own Chuck Schumer. Instead, they are relying on a tightening presidential race, deep-pocketed outside groups and candidates who are running far ahead of Trump to eke out a win.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a machine,\u201d Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said of Schumer, his workout partner. But \u201cit may not make a difference,\u201d the Texan added.\n\n\n\nAuthors:"

Brown, the executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, seemed to side with the Republican nominee, saying in a television interview that \u2018it\u2019s not a good idea to get the moderator into essentially serving as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\u2019 She added, however, that ultimately it will be up to Monday\u2019s moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, to do the job as he sees fit.\u201d http://wapo.st/2cZsVVJ\n\nTHE CLINTON CAMPAIGN says it\u2019s hosting more than 1,200 debate watch parties in 50 states.

Clinton deserves the same, but she is already the single most scrutinized, parsed, vetted, investigated, attacked and plaudited non-incumbent to ever seek the presidency. She\u2019s been around forever, making enemies since the internet was dial-up, cell phones were the size of skateboards and Trump was engaged to Marla Maples.\n\n\u201cEveryone makes the orange jokes, but Trump is something of a black box -- running on a few big and broad ideas (curbing illegal immigration, ditching bad trade deals, restoring American prosperity to the working class and obliterating political correctness). He\u2019s bad with facts and the truth, and perhaps worse, takes perverse pride in being a D student who doesn't read books, has the sketchiest sense of history, doesn't read briefing materials, and, according to aides and ghostwriters, can't even sit still long enough to be given a thorough verbal briefing.\n\n\u201c1.

One reality they\u2019re unlikely to note: Whoever wins in November will enjoy far less latitude to spend money or cut taxes than any president since World War II.

Just six weeks after he dropped out \u2013 and more than a month before Cruz would dramatically snub the nominee at the Republican National Convention \u2013 the senator quietly began renting his vast donor email file to his former rival, pocketing at least tens of thousands of dollars, and more likely hundreds of thousands, that can be used to bankroll the Texan\u2019s own political future. ... [A]n email rate sheet obtained by POLITICO shows that Cruz asks campaigns to pay more than $22,000 for the right to send a single email his list of 280,000 digital donors.

Trump struck a very different tone on Sunday, telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would recognize an undivided Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s eternal capital and squarely blaming Palestinian \u2018hatred and violence\u2019 for the ongoing failure of Middle East peace efforts.\n\n\u201cNot to be outdone, in her own meeting with Netanyahu a few hours later, Clinton told the Israeli leader that she opposes, in the words of a senior campaign aide, \u2018any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.\u2019 \u2026 The two get-togethers spotlighted the U.S.-Israel relationship on the eve of the first presidential debate and likely drew the close attention of Jewish American voters.

From that moment of combustion, it became clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s views were matters of dangerous impulse and cynical pandering rather than thoughtful politics. Yet he has attracted throngs of Americans who ascribe higher purpose to him than he has demonstrated in a freewheeling campaign marked by bursts of false and outrageous allegations, personal insults, xenophobic nationalism, unapologetic sexism and positions that shift according to his audience and his whims.\u201d http://nyti.ms/2cP5lpd\n\nAIR WARS -- \u201cCoal industry mounts unusual court-focused ad campaign,\u201d by Josh Gerstein: \u201cFor the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C.

In mid-July Politico reported that Mr. Ailes had once talked about dispatching thugs to beat up Mr. Sherman. It is unclear how serious he was. But now that Mr. Ailes had lost his job, it seemed possible that he would also lose his famously volatile temper. So Mr. Sherman and the editors at New York hired some muscle. ...\n\n\u201c[I]n the summer of 2012, [Sherman's wife] spotted a black sport utility vehicle at the bottom of the driveway at a house in Vermont that she and Mr. Sherman had rented. The place was on a dead-end dirt road, in a tiny town where pickup trucks are the norm. When Ms. Stahl started walking toward the vehicle, it pulled into the driveway of a neighbor, who wasn't home. Who was in this car was never known, though Mr. Sherman assumed it was an Ailes operative.

The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.\n\nRanbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.\n\nThe Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation\u2019s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,\u201d said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.\n\n\u201cWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA\u2019s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,\u201d said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.\n\nThe Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, \u201calleged due to the company\u2019s diluted drugs, it \u2018subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,\u2019\u201d according to the report.\n\n\u201cThe question becomes, \u2018how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,\u2019\u201d asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.\n\nThe possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nBlackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term.\n\nThe congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThe most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation\u2019s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.\n\nIt is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the \u201cwatered-down\u201d drugs.\n\nProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered \u201cmore than $1.8 million packages.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,\u201d Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.\n\nThakur told TheDCNF that many of the company\u2019s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.\n\n\u201cThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,\u201d he said.\n\nRanbaxy\u2019s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.\n\nThe FDA sent a public \u201cwarning letter\u201d to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company\u2019s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, \u201cshow much lower potencies in these batches.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ranbaxy\u2019s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company\u2019s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.\n\nBill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.\n\nNeither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.\n\nThakur said he\u2019s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on \u201caccess\u201d to patients.\n\nThe whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. \u201cI have tried to reach out to them,\u201d he told TheDCNF. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nCHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.\n\nCharles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was \u201cdeeply suspect.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called \u2018CHAI\u2019 was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,\u201d Ortel told TheDCNF.\n\nThe congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.\n\nHe signed an executive order that, \u201crelaxed intellectual property policy standards,\u201d promising the U.S. government \u201cwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any \u2018Sub-Saharan country\u2019 relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,\u201d the report states.\n\nCHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nCHAI\u2019s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief \u2014 a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton\u2019s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become \u201cgood acquisition targets,\u201d according to the study.\n\nRanbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.\n\nThe companies enjoyed great financial profits and they \u201cexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.\n\nOne relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.\n\nRajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.\n\nVinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.\n\nBlackburn says the worst part of the story were the \u201cfalse hopes\u201d offered by the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it\u2019s disturbing and very sad,\u201d she said.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com"

Jean Shepard was 82 years old and after only a couple of days in hospice care we had to say our goodbyes.\n\nJean Shepard was a Grand Ole Opry member and she wasn\u2019t just any member. Shepard was known as the \u201cGrand Lady\u201d. In 1955 she was inducted and in 2015 she was the only female that had ever been a member of the Opry for 60 years \u2013 which is how she earned the name.\n\nThe Grand Lady was also inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame a couple of years ago in 2011. She was passionate about country music, and loved what it stood for.\n\nOf course, like many older stars she felt like country music just isn\u2019t the same as what it used to be. In one of her final interviews with Women Of Country at the Grand Ole Opry she told all.\n\n\u201cSixty years ago, I loved what the Grand Ole Opry stood for,\u2026I still love what it stands for, but not quite so much.

At age 14 she was spotted by country star Hank Thompson singing and playing bass in the all-girl band she\u2019d formed called the Melody Ranch Girls. Thompson brought her to the attention of Capitol Records and soon the trailblazing Shepard was setting the precedent in country music for a young woman recording and touring on her own rather than as a member of a family act, a duo, or a band\u2019s \u2018girl singer.'\u201d\n\nThere is truly no one like Jean, and there never will be another Grand Lady.

	"text": "If I hadn\u2019t seen the last fifteen months of this campaign, I\u2019d have no problem in asserting who won this first debate on Monday night. It was Hillary Clinton, whether the issue was the way she looked on stage, or got the better of Donald Trump in most exchanges, or her calm, somewhat more presidential demeanor.\n\nSo what\u2019s my hesitancy in proclaiming her the winner? It has to do with Trump\u2019s not failing badly. He did not show himself to be \u201cunfit\u201d for the presidency, which was Clinton\u2019s main accusation against him. In the countless other occasions\u2014from his announcement speech on\u2014the ordinary rules of politics would have decreed that Trump\u2019s campaign was wounded, crippled, dead. His supporters\u2014and every stage in the campaign has showed them to be far more numerous than had been thought\u2014do not hear him the way those of us who\u2019ve covered campaigns do. The insults, the sneers? That just shows he\u2019s the one person who can get up in the grill of the elites, the establishment, the people who have ignored us, ridiculed us, left us behind. And what of his lack of knowledge (demonstrated once again in his talk about nuclear proliferation on Monday night)? It doesn\u2019t matter, because he\u2019s got the right instincts to upend a corrupt system.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf he\u2019s blustery, self-confident to the point of arrogance, dismissive of subtleties, then that\u2019s a sign that he\u2019s a bold, fearless advocate, as he showed again Monday night.\n\nMeasured by that standard, did anything in this debate suggest that he is \u201cunfit\u201d for the job, as so many newspaper editorials and condemnations by traditional Republicans have argued? Clinton did bring up the 50 GOP national security experts who have rejected him, but Trump simply replied by citing a list of high-ranking military officers who are supporting him.\n\nAnd what of other standard measure? Atmospherics? She was clearly happier to be on stage than he was; his water consumption suggested a subtle Marco Rubio impersonation. Demeanor? It\u2019s hard to imagine any of those wavering college-educated women finding his constant constant interruptions appealing.\n\nOn the respective vulnerabilities? He launched one brief attack on her 33,000 emails and then \u2026 the issue went away. By contrast, she laid down attack after attack on his taxes, his business ethics, his treatment of women, and the \u201cbirther\u201d issue, which he linked to outright racism. And his \u201cdefenses\u201d\u2014that he \u201dtook advantage of the laws of the nation\u201d in his dealings with contractors, in his explanation of his missing taxes\u2014were somewhere between unconvincing and incoherent. It\u2019s telling that one of his more effective segments came in talking about crime, when he argued that \u201cthe people that are most affected by what's happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it's very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen.\u201d\n\nMoreover, her calmer demeanor enabled her to level some remarkably harsh attacks; calling his birther argument flat out \u201cracist:\u2019 charging he\u2019d \u201cstiffed\u201d many of those who\u2019d worked for him. (She managed a more human touch by noting how happy she was that her father, a middle-class draper, never worked for Trump.)\n\nFinally, at the very end of the debate, moderator Lester Holt confronted Trump with his statement that Clinton did not have the \u201clook\u201d of a president\u2014a clear implication that this was a matter of gender. When Trump tried to shift the ground to a question of \u201cstamina,\u201d a smiling Clinton was ready.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cas soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina.\u201d\n\nThat worked very well. I have little doubt that Clinton will be proclaimed the winner of this debate; by any traditional measure, she was. But if this campaign so far has proven anything, it\u2019s that traditional measures have measured very little about what has happened. And I\u2019m very leery about applying traditional measures to this debate.\n\nJeff Greenfield is a five-time Emmy-winning network television analyst and author."

That\u2019s big news! It\u2019s also, like 99.9 percent of what Donald Trump says, a gigantic lie, according to Ford CEO Mark Fields, who told CNN:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate when politics get in the way of the facts.\u201d\n\nCNN host Poppy Harlow then asked Fields, would Ford cut any American jobs as part of its plans to build a new manufacturing plant in Mexico? To that, Fields replied:\n\n\u201cAbsolutely not. Zero. Not one job will be lost. Most of our investment is here in the US.

	"text": "On the night of September 26, as the house lights dim in the Mack Complex at Hofstra University and the TV cameras go live, millions of Americans will be riveted to the scene. Will Donald Trump seem well prepared? Will Hillary Clinton\u2019s commanding grasp of policy and nuance dazzle viewers? Will either candidate rise to the challenge and show voters that they have what it takes to be president?\n\nExperience suggests it\u2019s hard to make a positive breakthrough\u2014especially with two candidates so well known and so widely disliked. But what is possible is a serious unforced error.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nOver the 56 years that presidential debates have been televised, one of their great legacies has been the sudden, public gaffe\u2014a mistake live on TV that permanently cements the way voters see the candidate.\n\nDespite the hopeful aspirations of those voters who welcome a few hours of substantive deliberation on the major issues of the day, the truth is that these are televised performances. What the candidates say often matters less than how they look and what they do with their bodies: Every breath they take, every expression they make, and every emotion they convey can play a major role in determining how Americans evaluate their performances. And although debates don\u2019t usually transform how most voters think of the candidates, they do confirm voters\u2019 impressions\u2014which matters on Election Day.\n\nFor both candidates, this will be a particularly big challenge. Donald Trump is a larger-than-life presence who likes to intimidate, cajole and verbally bully his opponents by saying things long considered out of bounds\u2014which could lead to an unforced error by Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton, who sometimes betrays an aversion to letting too much emotion show, has a steely temperament and stinging wit that could easily get under Trump\u2019s skin, instigating him into losing control with the cameras rolling. If either of these happens, it will join the long line of memorable, campaign-changing moments that candidates fumbled into.\n\n1. 1960: Nixon sweats while debating JFK\n\nFamously, the very first televised presidential debate offered early evidence that all future debates would be visual affairs. After eight years as vice president, Richard Nixon was running to inherit the White House from the enormously popular Dwight Eisenhower. His challenger was John F. Kennedy, the charismatic young Massachusetts senator whose eloquence and matinee-idol looks captivated much of the nation.\n\nOn September 26, at the candidates\u2019 first debate, Nixon proved to be in strong command of policy. But he looked terrible. Famously, prior to the debate, he declined to have any makeup applied to his face. But that decision was made worse by the fact that for much of the previous two weeks, Nixon had been away from the campaign trail nursing a knee infection. As a result, he looked peaked.\n\nVideo: The Biggest Unforced Errors in Debate History From Richard Nixon sweating on camera during the first presidential debate to George H.W. Bush checking his watch before an audience question\u2014here are some of the most prominent debate gaffes in U.S. history.\n\nDuring their televised rumble, Nixon could be seen sweating and, on camera, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. His pale color and five o'clock shadow didn\u2019t help. All of which undercut his performance against Kennedy, who was a vision of youthful vigor.\n\n2. 1976: Ford and Carter freeze in a moment of crisis\n\nA more dramatic moment occurred on September 23, 1976, when the sound system malfunctioned in Philadelphia\u2019s Walnut Street Theater, forcing a 27-minute delay during the debate, during which President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter awkwardly stood still on stage. The broadcast continued as the television crew worked furiously to fix the technical problems.\n\nNeither candidate wanted to move, fearing that it would somehow look bad to audiences at home, so instead they stood frozen in a comic parody better than anything that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d could imagine. Moderators Robert McNeil and Jim Lehrer kept talking as the candidates \u201cstood helplessly like two Hollywood stand-ins,\u201d wrote Jules Witcover in the Washington Post.\n\nYears later, Ford admitted that \u201cI suspect both of us would have liked to sit down and relax while the technicians were fixing the system, but I think both of us were hesitant to make any gesture that might look like we weren\u2019t physically or mentally able to handle a problem like this.\u201d In the end, both men were diminished; they seemed less like leaders than deer caught in headlights.\n\n3. 1980: Carter\u2019s grim-faced critiques seem too self-serious\n\nIn politics, brevity can be a virtue. During his only debate with Ronald Reagan in the fall of 1980, Jimmy Carter didn\u2019t get that lesson.\n\nIn front of a record-breaking 80.6 million viewers, Carter was hoping to paint Ronald Reagan as a creature of the far right\u2014someone like Barry Goldwater, the GOP nominee whom Lyndon Johnson so successfully branded as an extremist some 16 years earlier. As Reagan sought to present himself as a more moderate, relatable Republican, Carter tried to forcefully punch back in the form of a lengthy and detailed monologue about health care and how Reagan had opposed Medicare in 1964.\n\nWhile Carter looked grim on the attack, Reagan grinned like a mildly disappointed father and shot back with just one phrase: \u201cThere you go again,\u201d he said with a laugh. The line undercut Carter\u2019s entire argument, making Reagan look like the bigger man.\n\n4. 1984: Mondale lets Reagan\u2019s one-liner negate a serious weakness\n\nDuring 1984\u2019s first debate, Reagan, then 73, aroused concern when he seemed to have trouble remembering his answers or following the questions. He stumbled over his words and lacked clarity with each statement. His opponent, former Vice President Walter Mondale, was crisp and sharp. In contrast, Reagan rambled through his closing statement to the alarm of his advisers. Lou Cannon wrote that Reagan left the stage admitting to campaign adviser Stu Spencer \u201cthat he had flopped.\u201d The Wall Street Journal\u2019s headline the next morning captured the zeitgeist: \u201cNew Question in Race: Is Oldest President Now Showing his Age?\u201d\n\nFortunately for Reagan, he came back with a vengeance. In a later debate, when Baltimore Sun journalist Henry Trewitt asked Reagan if his age would prevent him from fulfilling the rigors of the presidency, Reagan had a quip for the ages: \u201cI will not make age an issue in this campaign. I will not exploit, for political purposes, my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d\n\nThe audience erupted in laughter, including Mondale, which completely undercut the seriousness of the underlying charge.\n\n5. 1988: Dukakis seems cold in the face of a deeply personal question\n\nPerhaps the most shocking and controversial opening question in any presidential debate was posed by CNN anchor Bernard Shaw to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis at the second debate of 1988.\n\nDukakis was widely seen as a technocrat, a man whose inner character remained a mystery to many voters. The night before the debate, at 2 a.m., Shaw thought of the question that could crack that shell and elicit passion from the candidate. And so he began the debate with it: \u201cGovernor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\u201d\n\nReporters were shocked, but Dukakis seemed unperturbed. In a clinical and dispassionate manner, Dukakis simply said \u201cNo, I don\u2019t Bernard, and I think you know that I\u2019ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life. I don\u2019t see any evidence that it\u2019s a deterrent, and I think there are better and more effective ways to deal with violent crime.\u201d\n\nIt was as though Dukakis was talking about a stranger, answering in the same tone that a professor might use to explain a basic point of fact in the classroom. Voters were taken aback by how little passion the candidate seemed to have. \u201cIt was a question about Dukakis\u2019s values and emotions,\u201d his campaign director, Susan Estrich, later recalled. \u201cWhen he answered by talking policy, I knew we lost the election.\u201d\n\n6. 1992: Bush checks his watch while an audience member asks a question\n\nDuring the 1992 campaign, few moments were more devastating to George H.W. Bush than his decision to look at his wrist watch in the middle of a town-hall debate with Bill Clinton and Ross Perot.\n\nRight before an audience member asked the candidates how the national debt personally affected the lives of the candidates and how they could relate to the economic challenges of average Americans, Bush was seen looking down to figure out how many minutes were left. \u201cOnly 10 more minutes of this crap,\u201d Bush would later say he was thinking at the time.\n\nChecking the time would\u2019ve been unflattering in a normal debate setup, but coming as it did\u2014during a debate in which ordinary Americans posed questions to the presidential candidates\u2014it seemed like Bush was bored and uninterested in hearing what real people had to say. For a candidate already under attack for not being concerned about domestic policy, his glance seemed to confirm everything that was said about him.\n\n7. 2000: Gore sighs, eye-rolls and miscalculates in a confrontation with Bush\n\nEntering the debates in 2000, Vice President Al Gore and his supporters were pretty confident that they were up against a political lightweight in George W. Bush. Gore had been in high-profile debates before, and his team was confident that the debates would show American voters that Bush, a relative lightweight known to stumble over his words, lacked the clarity and gravitas needed to be president.\n\nDuring the first debate, Gore\u2019s overdramatic attempts to emphasize how exasperated he was with Bush backfired big time. At several points, microphones caught Gore loudly sighing in response to Bush\u2019s answers, which played into Republican arguments that he was arrogant and condescending. And as Bush criticized the Democrat\u2019s plans for their \u201cfuzzy math,\u201d Gore was seen on the split screen rolling his eyes and shaking his head in frustration.\n\nAt the third debate, a town-hall-style affair, one of the oddest moments of this or any other debate happened: Gore walked right up to Bush as he was speaking, as if to physically intimidate him. Looking up with an annoyed glance, Bush seized the moment, nodding his head with a smirk, and continuing on with his statement, making Gore\u2019s action look odd as the audience laughed.\n\nDonna Brazile, who ran Gore\u2019s campaign, believed that Gore won the debates on policy but \u201con mannerisms and the takeaway, he ended up losing \u2026 many of us remember the split-screen, and Al Gore was sitting there, rolling his eyes, perhaps, looking at George Bush, and basically he started to sigh.\u201d\n\n8. 2004: Bush cannot contain his irritation at Kerry\n\nAfter the first debate of the general election in 2000, President Bush came under criticism when he couldn\u2019t contain how annoyed he was by some of the comments his opponent, Senator John Kerry, made about Bush\u2019s record.\n\nThough Bush had benefited from the visuals of his 2000 debates against Vice President Al Gore, the critics weren\u2019t so kind to Bush in 2004, when cameras caught him scowling, clenching his jaw and leaning tensely over his lectern, as he listened to Kerry speak. The Democratic National Committee didn\u2019t wait long to pounce on the president. In their online video, \u201cFaces of Frustration,\u201d viewers were treated to a repeat of the split screen showing Kerry calmly speaking on the left side of the screen with Bush\u2019s angry looks on the right side.\n\n***\n\nAppearances are not the only thing that matters in the debates, of course. What the candidates say will be endlessly scrutinized with the media, while the quality of the one-line zingers, particularly in the viral age of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, are important in shaping perceptions of the event.\n\nAnd on September 26, 56 years to the day since Nixon awkwardly sweated his way through the debate with JFK, we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nJulian E.

Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas, who have vowed to block any ambassador nomination for Cuba.\n\nStill, Obama's decision suggests he's willing to take on the risk of a dragged-out fight over a topic \u2014 Cuba-U.S. relations \u2014 that has increasing bipartisan support.\n\nThe island nation restored diplomatic ties with the U.S. in July 2015 after more than 50 years of hostility, and Obama considers America's new relationship with Cuba one of his signature foreign policy achievements.\n\nDeLaurentis is a career member of the U.S. foreign service who has been the chief of mission at the U.S. embassy in Havana since it was re-established in 2015 and headed what was an American interests section there before that. He was widely believed to be the frontrunner for the ambassador's job should Obama select a nominee.\n\n\"The appointment of an ambassador is a common sense step forward toward a more normal and productive relationship between our two countries,\" Obama said in a statement announcing his decision.\n\nAmong those appaluding Obama's decision was Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who has long advocated for better U.S.-Cuba relations.\n\n\"Americans traveling & doing business in #Cuba will be well-served by the prompt confirmation of Jeff DeLaurentis to serve as US ambassador,\" Flake tweeted.\n\nBut although a growing number of Republicans have shown support for deepening ties to Cuba, it takes only a single senator to severely slow down a nomination process for an ambassador.\n\nAsked by POLITICO earlier this year whether he still held firm to his denouncement of the rapprochement with Cuba and his vow to block an ambassador confirmation, Rubio said yes.\n\n\"A U.S. ambassador is not going to influence the Cuban government, which is a dictatorial, closed regime,\u201d the senator, who is of Cuban descent, said as the one-year anniversary of Cuba-U.S. ties loomed.\n\nRubio's office subsequently issued a statement assailing the nomination.\n\n\"This nomination,\" Rubio said, \"should go nowhere until the Castro regime makes significant and irreversible progress in the areas of human rights and political freedom for the Cuban people.\"\n\nAuthors:"

	"text": "AP Photo Backtalk Robert Kennedy Would Have Hated Donald Trump The GOP candidate is not the man of peace my former colleague makes him out to be.\n\nWriting as a former legislative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and an enthusiastic supporter of Hillary Clinton for president, I was disappointed to see in Politico the screed written by my former colleague, Adam Walinsky, excoriating Clinton\u2019s record on foreign policy and national security and going on to conclude that Donald Trump should therefore be elected president. It is one thing to disagree with Secretary Clinton, which Walinsky does heatedly, and quite another to turn to Donald Trump.\n\nWe should be clear that Walinsky\u2019s critique is not confined to Clinton. He lays out (and massively overstates) a dark view not just of Clinton but also of President Obama and almost the entire Democratic Party. The analysis is overwrought, but even one who buys the argument defies all logic in imagining that the solution is Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe question is not whether there is a military-industrial complex in our country. President Eisenhower called us out on that and there is enough responsibility to go around among both parties for it. The 21st century version begins with the Iraq War, which was originated by a Republican President. I am not interested in adjudicating the issue of which party is the war party except to say that Presidents Obama, Clinton and Carter have stood for peace in important and tangible ways. The question here is whether Donald Trump can claim in any way that he is the candidate who stands for a foreign policy of restraint and the answer is that he cannot.\n\nWalinsky finds in Trump a rationality and consistency that do not exist. Any reasonable observer of the presidential campaign has seen that at one moment, Trump will represent himself as an isolationist who wants to end ties with NATO and other allies; at another, he will lash out at any perceived insult to the U.S. or to himself, and pledges that America\u2019s pride needs to be vindicated militarily. \u201cAmerica First,\u201d Trump says regularly, bringing the isolationism of Charles Lindbergh to mind\u2014before excoriating President Obama for not using greater force in any number of venues and then insinuating that he has a secret plan to obliterate the Islamic State.\n\nTo compare John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy to Donald Trump is\u2014well, I won\u2019t finish the sentence. Yes, Robert Kennedy turned against the Vietnam War, but not because he felt that America should retreat from the world. He opposed the war because it was unjust and was based on a flawed notion of American interests. The result, as we know, was the death of Vietnamese and Americans and others who should not have died. JFK and RFK were internationalists. They understood that World War II left the United States with a responsibility to play an active and constructive role in the world. They understood that America must stand together and dependably with allies who also are committed to pursue a peaceful world. They understood that the use of force was sometimes necessary and that brave men and women would be put at risk. They made those difficult, often excruciating, decisions carefully and as transparently as possible, never rashly, impulsively, or vindictively.\n\nWalinsky quotes Robert Kennedy\u2019s statement that if any member of the ExComm other than John F. Kennedy had been president during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we would have had a nuclear war. Ask yourself what a President Trump might have done in that moment. \u201cRestraint\u201d is not the word that comes to mind.\n\nThis is a man who said he would order the military to kill the families of Muslim terrorists and use interrogation techniques worse than waterboarding and opined that the United States should have seized Iraq\u2019s oil resources as \u201cspoils to the victor.\u201d\n\nYes, we have put too much power in the hands of militarists and profit seekers in both the public and private sectors. But electing Donald Trump is not the answer; it would only compound the problem in new and dangerous ways. The answer is an active citizenry that speaks out against the inappropriate use of force and opposes interference in conflicts that involve neither American security interests nor egregious human rights violations\u2014a topic in which Donald Trump has shown an ostentatious indifference, as his fondness for Vladimir Putin reflects.\n\nAll the evidence, provided again and again by Donald Trump\u2019s own mouth, tells us not that he is a man of peace, but that he is a man of no principle\u2014a man who will say, and possibly do, whatever happens to cross his mind at a given minute. He is like the weather in New England: If you don\u2019t like it, wait a minute. We do not know what he believes because he does not know what he believes. We do not know what he knows because, from all we can see, he does not know much.\n\nEven if Walinsky\u2019s diatribe is correct, which it most certainly is not in its breadth and depth, there is nothing in it that justifies turning to Donald Trump. Of all occasions to break ranks with the Democratic Party, this is the most inappropriate. Of all the ways to misappropriate the memory of John and Robert Kennedy, two of our greatest public servants, this is the most egregious I have ever seen.\n\nTo say that I am disappointed by what Walinsky has done is an understatement. America, in this election, faces an existential question\u2014and history will judge us by our answer. Walinsky has chosen the wrong side of the struggle.\n\nPeter Edelman is the Carmack Waterhouse professor of law and public policy at Georgetown University Law Center."

	"text": "Nine years ago, a driver lost control of his pickup truck and crashed into the Confederate monument on the front lawn of the Franklin County Courthouse, decapitating the marble soldier. Some locals who found the monument offensive said they were glad to see it go, but there was never much doubt that once the money was raised, the soldier would be back.\n\nThe rededication ceremony in 2010 drew a crowd of about 500 people\u2014women wore hoop skirts and men donned the gray uniforms of Confederate soldiers. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of it,\u201d says Linda Stanley, managing director of the Franklin County Historical Society in Rocky Mount, Virginia, 25 miles southeast of Roanoke. \u201cThis whole county\u2019s very, very patriotic.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThis was the way skirmishes over Confederate history have often gone\u2014history is replaced, not rewritten. That is, until last year, when white supremacist Dylann Roof gunned down nine people at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina. The massacre set off a national debate about Confederate symbols in public places, leading to an intense and ultimately successful campaign to permanently remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds, where it had flown for decades.\n\nBut for every nationally publicized debate like the one over South Carolina\u2019s flag, there are dozens of smaller battles in places like Franklin County. And this is especially true in Virginia, which, as the former home to the capital of the Confederacy, has more Confederate monuments\u2014223\u2014than any other state. Virginia, increasingly diverse and progressive, embodies the friction between the economic aspirations of the \u201cNew South\u201d and the still powerful nostalgia of the Old Dominion, and it\u2019s a drama that is playing out in town squares across the state.\n\nThough a Quinnipiac University poll last summer found Virginians evenly divided on the governor\u2019s decision to remove the Confederate flag from state license plates, pride in local monuments remains strong. When city leaders in Danville, on Virginia\u2019s southern border, voted to remove a Confederate flag from the grounds of the Sutherlin Mansion\u2014known as the Last Capitol of the Confederacy\u2014Confederate preservationists struck back. They filed a lawsuit seeking to have the flag reinstated, arguing that it was part of a war memorial, and that Virginia law protected all war memorials in the state. Last fall, a circuit court judge ruled against them.\n\nThat ruling\u2014along with the increasingly frequent threats to monuments around the state\u2014prompted the Republican delegate from Franklin County to demand in January a blanket protection for what has been a feature of Southern urban landscapes for more than a century. Charles Poindexter introduced a bill in the General Assembly to prevent the removal of all war monuments, regardless of when they were built. \u201cIf you eliminate these monuments and memorials, you\u2019re taking away the opportunity to learn the history of the country\u2014to learn the good, the bad and ugly,\u201d Poindexter says.\n\nMany of his colleagues in the Virginia Legislature agreed with him. But in March, Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe vetoed the bill, saying cities and towns should decide what to do with their Confederate monuments, based on their individual histories. Some historians and civic leaders think the debate over Confederate symbols in public spaces, which began in the 1960s, will take decades to play out.\n\n\u201cEvery little statue\u2019s a part of a much larger discussion and movement,\u201d says Edward Ayers, former president of the University of Richmond and noted Civil War historian. \u201cAfrican-Americans now have a political voice, and this is one of the things that they\u2019re using it for.\u201d\n\n***\n\nMark Whitaker remembers walking by the 30-foot-tall Confederate monument in Portsmouth, Virginia, when he was a kid. Shopping at a store across the street, he resented looking at the obelisk guarded by stone soldiers; his parents had told him what it represented. \u201cMy ancestors could not say a thing in the face of that indignity,\u201d Whitaker says.\n\nNow, as an African-American City Council member in a city that is 53 percent black, he wants to remove the monument from the center of Olde Towne, and perhaps put it in a cemetery. \u201cThese monuments are really a rally and a celebration [of] the rise of an institution that oppressed black people,\u201d he says.\n\nMany of the Confederate monuments were built from the 1880s through the 1920s, an era when Civil War veterans were dying and their descendants were eager to honor them. It was also the era immediately following Reconstruction, when federal troops abandoned the South and whites aimed to reassert power through Jim Crow laws, lynchings and groups such as the Ku Klux Klan. Granite and marble monuments proclaimed that power, often in the center of town.\n\nBut even in a majority-black city on the eastern shore of the state, Whitaker has battled to get Portsmouth\u2019s monument removed. Last summer, attorney Fred Taylor, who also represented Confederate preservationists in the Danville case, warned the city that state law prohibited it from moving the monument. \u201cWe believe the monument protection act covers the monument in Danville, covers the monument in Portsmouth,\u201d Taylor says. He argues that the original Virginia statute protecting war monuments dates back to 1902, so \u201cthere has been protection all along.\u201d\n\nWhen the circuit court judge ruled against him in Danville, Taylor appealed the case to the Virginia Supreme Court. So far, the court has not agreed to hear the case.\n\nBack in Portsmouth, the debate continues. Some residents don\u2019t want the city to spend upward of $100,000 to move the monument\u2014a position Whitaker finds ridiculous. \u201cWhy now, when we talk about moving a symbol of racism, we\u2019re concerned about cost?\u201d\n\nHe says the Portsmouth City Council had been waiting to hear the outcome of the Danville court case but could resume its discussion of the monument after the November elections. \u201cWe\u2019re on solid legal grounds to remove it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need four votes.\u201d\n\n***\n\nOther Virginia cities have struck a middle ground, forming committees to figure out what to do with their Confederate monuments. In May, Charlottesville convened a Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials, and Public Spaces. Although the move was sparked by a controversial statue of Robert E. Lee in a public park, Mayor Mike Signer was determined to broaden the conversation, with an eye toward changing the city\u2019s entire historic landscape.\n\nHe asked the commission to look at several landmarks, from an African-American cemetery that had fallen into disrepair to the statue of a Confederate boy in front of the courthouse. Members of the panel have discussed rehabbing and creating new historic interpretations for these sites, building new monuments to African-American leaders and linking all the sites so that visitors can see how they are connected. There might even be a virtual, mobile educational component to help people navigate the sites. The goal, Signer says, is to change the narrative of Charlottesville \u201cby telling the full story of race through our public spaces.\u201d The commission is slated to give its recommendations to the City Council in December.\n\nIn the wealthy, heavily Democratic city of Alexandria, a similar advisory group decided not to remove the Appomattox statue in the middle of Old Town, which depicts a defeated Confederate soldier with his eyes downcast. The United Daughters of the Confederacy owns the monument, and moving it would require approval from the Virginia General Assembly. Also, as the advisory group noted, Appomattox is one of the rare Confederate statues that marks a historic site\u2014the place where the 17th Virginia Regiment gathered to withdraw from Union occupation of the city in 1861. The group recommended labeling the statue with more historical context instead of taking it down.\n\n\u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is spray painted on a monument to former Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond, Virginia, in June 2015. | AP Photo\n\nRichmond, the former capital of the Confederacy, has an entire street lined with monuments to Confederate leaders. It\u2019s also a majority-black city. In June 2015, someone scrawled \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on the statue of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Yet Mayor Dwight Jones has not called for the monuments\u2019 removal. Instead, he suggested adding more statues of prominent black leaders\u2014such as the bronze of tennis legend Arthur Ashe, who was born in Richmond, that the city erected in 1995. \u201cRather than tearing down, we should be building up in ways that establish a proper sense of balance and fairness by recognizing heroes from all eras to tell a richer and more accurate story of Virginia\u2019s history,\u201d Jones said in a statement last summer.\n\nDelegate Poindexter tends to agree with Jones, although he\u2019s fuzzy on the specifics. Asked whether he would be in favor of adding more historical context to existing Confederate monuments, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s far better than tearing down the current ones.\u201d\n\nIn his eyes, the era in which the Confederate monuments were erected is \u201cirrelevant.\u201d \u201cThey need to be respected,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know what we know today. That\u2019s why these monuments are important.\u201d\n\nAyers says many people who push to preserve Confederate monuments share this attitude. \u201cThe white South has always been on the defensive ever since it tried to leave the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken what ground they can get, and what they can get is personal memory and memorialization. It\u2019s an amalgam of power and weakness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re meant to do work,\u201d Ayers says. \u201cThe work that they were meant to do, in some ways they\u2019re still doing: Saying that this is a place where local white people call the shots.\u201d\n\n***\n\nIn Franklin County, the power struggle is deeply personal. Stanley says the area sent about 3,000 Confederate soldiers to what she calls \u201cThe War Between the States.\u201d Veterans who returned home became mayors and town clerks and delegates. Beginning in 1902, the local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy started raising money for a memorial to honor the sons, fathers and husbands who never made it home. They dedicated the monument in front of the courthouse in 1910.\n\nOne of the people who agreed to donate money to the project was Booker T. Washington, the famed African-American educator who was born into slavery on a farm in Franklin County in 1856. In 1905, he wrote a letter offering to contribute funds for the Confederate memorial, in honor of the family that owned him. As far as Stanley knows, Washington did contribute some amount, \u201cwe just don\u2019t have a copy of the actual check.\u201d\n\nPoindexter says Franklin County \u201clost hundreds of its best men\u201d in the Civil War, and for decades afterward, Reconstruction was \u201ca horrible process\u201d that had a big impact on the region.\n\nToday, Franklin County is home to about 56,200 people, 90 percent of whom are white. They elected Poindexter, a conservative Christian with an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association, to the General Assembly for the first time in 2007. In 2014, the county had a median household income of $44,827, far below the state\u2019s median of $64,792. Its residents voted Republican in the past three presidential races, and many supported Poindexter\u2019s efforts to save war monuments. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want anybody pulling any monuments down,\u201d Stanley says.\n\nSoon after the county replaced the Confederate memorial in front of the courthouse, the local chapter of the NAACP suggested that a statue of Booker T. Washington be erected beside it. Other community leaders wanted to put up a pedestal honoring African-Americans who contributed to the county\u2019s Civil War effort. The county board of supervisors tabled their request, saying the community needed more time to discuss it.\n\nCivil War memorials are not generally a big tourist draw in the Roanoke region, says Landon Howard, president of Visit Virginia\u2019s Blue Ridge. \u201cTo be candid, we really do not get hardly any American Civil War visitation here.\u201d\n\nYet locals have their own loyalties. Every year, the Franklin County Historical Society celebrates Veterans Memorial Day, honoring all local casualties of military conflicts. According to the society\u2019s website, \u201cSpecial emphasis is placed on veterans of the War Between the States as this war touched literally every household in the county.\u201d\n\nConfederate General Jubal Early was born in Franklin County, and he\u2019s known as one of the rebels who never surrendered. \u201cHe became the primary spokesman for the Lost Cause and became the overwhelming authority on published Confederate history,\u201d says the website of the Jubal A. Early Homeplace.\n\nSpeaking by phone from his farm in Franklin County, Poindexter isn\u2019t ready to surrender, either. He doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019ll propose his monument protection bill again next year, but he hasn\u2019t ruled it out. \u201cIf you start tearing down monuments ... where do you stop?\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t change what was, but you can learn from it and not make that mistake again.\u201d\n\nLisa Rab is a journalist in Charlotte, N.C.

	"text": "Donald Trump is calling for one of the most controversial and racially charged policies enacted by police departments to be expanded across the entire country. The city of New York recently ended \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d but Trump is pushing for it, apparently egged on by his top campaign surrogate, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. From Politico:\n\nIn a pre-taped interview on Fox News scheduled to air Wednesday night, Trump was asked by an audience member what he would do to address \u201cviolence in the black community\u201d and \u201cblack-on-black crime.\u201d Trump responded by proposing that \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing, in which an officer is empowered to stop an individual and frisk them for weapons or any other illegal contraband, be adopted nationwide. \u201cI would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically,\u201d Trump told the questioner.\n\nStop-and-frisk was repeatedly called out and protested against by New York City residents because the policy was shown time and time again to disproportionately target black and Latino residents. They were singled out for examination and interrogation by police officers, in what some felt were quotas set up by police management.\n\nWhen the city stopped using stop-and-frisk, they did not see an increase in crime, despite claims from its supporters that there would be a spike in criminal activity. Most people who had been subject to stop-and-frisk were let go, because they hadn\u2019t done anything wrong.\n\nFormer US District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin, who had ruled the procedure unconstitutional in federal court, described it as \u201cdestructive\u201d in an interview with Buzzfeed. She added:\n\n\u201cIn short, the overstopping in many communities harmed the relationship between the people and the police. Cooperation has now improved due to positive efforts by police to work with the community not against it.\u201d\n\nFeatured image via Flickr"
